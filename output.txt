How long did Viola sign for. Three years? I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers. But I think they enforce it rather too strictly. These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals. Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart. If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks. Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris? Are there any automatic activation clauses? What is the buyout amount?f Cheers, -Valentine

Some thoughts and facts, 1.) Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc. However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name. (The handbook, but not the scoreboard). To the best of my knowledge, the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook. 2.) The debate over Elias goes way back. Bill James' early stuff was hampered by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price. Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void. You can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course. Or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself. Having attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they just don't do that. In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the information available at all. 3.) That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too. I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than April. Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer. (Bias alert. I am a former part-time employee of STATS.) Noel Rappin noel@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu

For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box scores from STATS, Inc. The AP representative in the press box is actually a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking. And anybody can do it.) The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP. I'm not sure where the appreveiations come in hear. I don't think it is at STATS's. It may just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new people. Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road to getting into the press box may be real short. For more info, call STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.

One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse. Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air, waving a big towel over his head. He looked like a big jerk, especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season. The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started. The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's jeep. Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that. I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats. Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed. Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine. In a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--I should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls. Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts. Bobby Kelly followed with a single and Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right. The big guys (Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a Tomlin wild pitch. In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0. Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple. Milligan would later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead after 4. The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing Tomlin. Barry later would score the final run on Tom Prince's two-base passed ball. The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope. Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though: relievers Blas Minor, Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work. Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb. He was taken to the hospital for "precautionary X-rays". Let's hope he's OK. Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar!

It was the game where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out, two-run homer to right to win it. (It wasn't the game where the fans threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer -- too bad, huh?) Well, the 'Stick is still cold. The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it was cold then. I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick. The wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea. At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time. I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths the infield) and grab the trash. It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers. Everybody wins here! Whaddaya think? Sean

He addressed this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly. According to Gammons, advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release. Guzman and Stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach. Gammons looks to see Morris back in top form within the month. I, on the other hand, still have my doubts. Morris' ERA last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games. His showing in the Series was not surprising. Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the Twins in '91. -Brian Klaff

Well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine. I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game. Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand. As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this. One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time. You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to go on until four in the morning. Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy. That's fine by me. Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel- surf and cater to their short attention spans. Heather HHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark- Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters. While he believes that Clark-Bonds- Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit ahead of Williams. I am inclined to agree with him. Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties very well. He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season. But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive hitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in the 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams. Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open because of the threat of Bonds stealing.

This is the situation that brought the question up: The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1. The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out. The batter hits a fly to center, which the fielder catches. The runner at third tags and scores without a throw. Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBI for the batter. It seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensive indifference", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point. (I know, I can think of several "If the Mariners stole third and second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, and maybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc... scenarios, too. But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you're down by 4? If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.) The point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get "credit" (an RBI) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, not trade an out for one run.

Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal Ripken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players in the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and Larkin, 4.7. The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8; Ventura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4 In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle, Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the writers of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one had the better year can be considered a toss-up.

Nntp-Posting-Host: summit.wpd.sgi.com Organization: Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA Lines: 22 I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order. Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year). Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle. Since Matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the Giants a lot. When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton. If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a big inning. Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double). The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.

An outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles. However, a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles. Has anyone seen these players' positioning? Do Butler and Felix play deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park effect? I thought Butler liked to play shallow. -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu "We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

Year G AB BA OBP SLG HR SB CS 1987 21 83 .265 .271 .386 2 4 2 1988 146 563 .259 .317 .439 19 19 10 <-- 3rd Base Expt. year 1989 75 260 .177 .237 .335 9 9 6 1990 152 575 .303 .357 .539 32 33 16 1991 154 561 .251 .338 .496 32 34 15 1992 153 544 .259 .321 .415 17 32 10 In the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time approx 4.5 seasons. Just looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF. His 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B. The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989. When he returned as an OF, he began hitting again. And of course, last year he slumped. But no learning curve? He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio. As to his fielding, he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through 2 position changes in the space of a year. He's an adequate OF, although not great, and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level. (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :) About playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field, after catcher. At SS or 2B, you need more range and speed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have a GUN for an arm. There are NO second chances at 3B, even when playing sandlot softball! Granted, I'd still put my best overall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder. It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B. But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B is scarce. Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve. You don't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work. Now, whether he's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough. You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach hustle. All that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term contract. He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he'll be 30. Given his career curve and limitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer. He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's got some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al. Eric

What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? >You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team". It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season: Player AVG AB Blauser .367 49 Grace .391 48 Milligan .400 35 Conine .375 40 Lansing .400 50 Slaught .406 32 Are any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant is Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If he'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next game he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let's talk then. >If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches >and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), >*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment >that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license >to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's >batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference >does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks? Sheesh. It's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he swings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when there's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks, but don't bet the rent money on it.

At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time.

A player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated better. That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year. Put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better. One of the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much. As a counterexample to what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987: Non-Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 Lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch" situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye. Well, in 1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch". Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch" at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias). As a simple measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88, 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were above in one and below in the other. If you were just flipping coins, you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched. The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant. BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level. Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 0.088, significant at no level of any interest. > > >> Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand >> slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three >> is a VERY clutch hit.

This sense creates drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's attention. In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about (here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time? And they're just playing a sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/ touch-self-in-interesting-locations. There's a lot of "dead time" with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans will appreciate that one). To the non baseball junkie this is boring. At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie. That's what Major League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game. It's because of T.V. not because "football has more action than baseball". ========================================================================= Steve Conroy | conroy@terminus.saic.com | "I'm gone, man - solid gone! | Science Applications | -Baloo International Corporation | =========================================================================

Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296. That's not exactly chopped liver. Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy.

A summary of the findings: Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful. They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill. Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without a runner on third. STATS concludes "So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING cage." gREG

From: macomber@sctc.com (Chuck Macomber) Subject: Twins Update 4-22 Organization: SCTC Lines: 88 TWINS UPDATE -- Posted April 22, 1993 --------------------------------------------- The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game homestand with the Brew crew. The Twins took two of three games in the series, with scores as follows: Tuesday April 20th MN 10 Mil 0 Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0) Wednesday April 21st Mil 10 (10) MN 8 LP - Hartley ( 0-1 ) Thursday April 22nd MN 5 Mil 4 WP - Deshaies (4-0) Sa - Aguilera Highlight/Low Lights of the Series: ------------------------------------ Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of the American League as well. Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning his ERA will climb slightly. Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail look like a true genius. Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting. Deshaies and Banks now combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are 0-5. Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the Twins this year (Rickey Bones). The Twins teed off against both him and subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead to 7-3. The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing 4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded. Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike Hartley one walk before the inning was over. This tied the game at 7-7, and the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win it. Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew. 6 of 20 career blown saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well. Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn, then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the side. Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie. Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth. General News ------------------------------------- Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on Tuesday's game. He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching, though, which has limited his playing time. Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed. The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow. Starting Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks. The Detroit Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff. The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield, the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively. Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second this year, and shows much improvement in this category. Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year. Some say he has the best 1st base move in baseball. This move has enabled him to pitch out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 start.

Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483 with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter. >>3.

They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks). They've just never figured out what to do with him.

From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3. Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and errors. It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently. It also hurts first baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few left-handed batters. > A better method, but newer and based ondata that has only been collected > over the last few years, measures the percentage of balls hit into the > part of the field the guy is responsible for.

This is certainly not the case. There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit. The "clutch pitching" quoted above is something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher. > Over the past four seasons Sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as > clutch situations (by The Scouting Report) for an average of .228. > Over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an > average of .294. > According to the rest of the SDCN's, any differential such as this is > completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable > inference, such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in > that situation. Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points, standard deviation about 30). There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays. And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability. *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past. But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit. Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage? (Any portion of Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.) Do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run? Do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves? -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu "We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans. Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field. I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season. A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason. Reggie Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right. The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages. > A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement > value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH. -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu "We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

As for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball. I'm not shy about it. I'll make the statement again. I believe that by season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch situations. I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Here's another one for you. In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non-clutch situations each year. I presume you think this is random. Non-Clutch: 1585 AB 411 H .259 Clutch: 338 AB 68 H .201 So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter? Well, his composite BA through 1989 was .268; through 1990 was .262; through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce. In 1992 he hit .264. Not surprising, huh? Also in 1992: Non-Clutch: 536 AB 144 H .269 Clutch: 86 AB 20 H .233 No, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers. It just makes me think that in 1993 Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non-clutch situations. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - As for #1 (above), I have plenty of company. John Dewan of STATS,INC. is the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text. Bill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit well in the clutch. I am not saying that I can predict the future any more than they are. You (and others) are saying that your work renders their statements (and mine) meaningless. I don't accept that, which in your words proves that I am a "total idiot". "Stupid". "Total idiot". My, my.

From: barring@cs.washington.edu (David Barrington) Subject: Mea Culpa -- Bosio no-no Organization: Computer Science & Engineering, U. of Washington, Seattle Lines: 46 Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster. My wife and I picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox offense. Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder by Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who threw to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense (many non-trivial groundouts). The game was amazingly fast, as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also working fast. The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch. Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it has always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was an MVP candidate). Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson made an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mike interpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the next two times. As Valentine noted, last night he came up in the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game. Can you say "take the first pitch"? Not Mike, who dribbled it into a 6-4-3. The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "batting practice fastball". Next time up he also hit the first pitch, a hard liner straight to KGJr in center. He also made the pathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight reel that night). Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively? I couldn't tell from the field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP that cost a run or two. Why was he leadoff? I hope Fletcher gets well soon. Also on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond me. It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good defense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back to Calgary!") There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did). Well, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in Langston.

This is not a knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has been more uniformly excellent.

From: pb6755@csc.albany.edu (BROWN PHILIP H) Subject: bosio's no-hitter Organization: State University of New York at Albany Lines: 19 I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play. -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu | --------------------------

One over the minimum, two bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches. I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me). But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have been a different story :-) Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in Major League baseball .... Pretty impressive in any league. Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year. Also, John Cummings (rookie) has had three solid outings with no support. If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year (relief is another story, though - grimace). Too cool. The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end. And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game.

Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve. (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch; the Y-axis being the number of players.) Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell. My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players). As a counterexample to >what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987: > > Non-Clutch Clutch > AB H BA AB H BA > >Maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 >Lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 > >If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch" >situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.

Before you accuse me of >completely cooking the data, You won't hear those kind of accusations from me. It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at. He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92 .217, .273, .250, .272 Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs. His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent. So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance. I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right. When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA. Ditto for Joe Carter. This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? >BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with >'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at >something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized >prior performance. You just wouldn't have used this particular >aspect of prior performance. Is this not correct? Right. I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past. Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles. All of these will give me some advantage if used properly. EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance. And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo. >One more time. I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future. >I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would >have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo. That comes down to the same thing. When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB. He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel. By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite. >And I am not dismissing your work. I'm stating my opinion. >You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary >invalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult >to your work. Well, yes.

I'd say this is insulting. >I did not say that it is a consistent skill. > > I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a > certain set of circumstances. RIGHT! This is the beef. It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances. At least none that we've been able to come up with. If you know of some where it *is* an indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret. >It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility >that you actually could have some preconceived biases. Most certainly. As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would love it! However the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably. >>Yeah. Hindsight is always 20-20. Doesn't that make you bright? This >>is a stupid argument and you know it. > >Ah. I knew we could get to the name calling. And there's that word >you like so much. Well, it was a stupid argument. (Are you honestly debating that???) Sure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit.

Or is this a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit (xxx amount?) worse in the clutch than overall? If you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and see. But the second is a much stronger statement. In fact, it suggests a rule. We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years. I think you will agree that if the rule didn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do any better this year. Right? >Here's another one for you.

He's nowhere near as bad as Steve >Garvey, but that's not much of a compliment. I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument. That "has great hands" means nothing. It seems to me that a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups. How many such chances does he get during a game? Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals). This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt. "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have value. I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar. It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose). Michael

Nntp-Posting-Host: bottom.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu Organization: The Ohio State University Lines: 28 To all the Braves doubters: Don't worry. The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around. The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well. Heck, with the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though). The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. Right now, the Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300! But I certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?). The bullpen... well, it IS suspect. But when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern. So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season. I'm not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim- istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at times right now). Go Braves!!! Dean.

This may be the root of the confusion... Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind. Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand. Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game. You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn. Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week. In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times. In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners. In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again. Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population. After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected. Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No. Because we know there is no skill involved. Nothing about these "consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning. But suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved. Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something. How would we test this hypothesis? We can look for correlations in the population. Now most of the population will show zero correlation. But our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years). Net result? A small positive correlation over the entire population. >This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having >with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical >history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before >it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply >statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? Well, zero correlation is zero correlation. You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years. But if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent. The length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year. Is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks? Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form", then we might have something useful. But then we wouldn't have zero correlation. Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse". You look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year". But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way. >I completely accept that reasoning. Again, what if we were to find >the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent >basis? Then we would have something useful. And we would also have a positive correlation. But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses. Cheers, -Valentine

Not the individual players. There is no method >inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. And that >is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game. There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism. In the biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of the game" and "organisms" for "teams". How we interpret "players" is trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make. A "genes" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, but that would be a different and probably longer post. If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z". Given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims. (But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto 'brain'). On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate). Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.) However, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable. Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs. In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms. >To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- >solutely that player A's team would have played better with player B >in their lineup. Sheer speculation. Impossible to ascertain. One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do. But, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty. Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research. >If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens >has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a >criteria, then fine. In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses. >But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the >individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only >measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball. This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another. Moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league. In at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts. But in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball. The same is true in biology. But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal. In the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful. It might be fun to watch, but it's unclear what it all really means. *** Now just one more un-related point: >I have yet to see that any of you can predict a >WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon. On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference between the winners and the losers. Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage. >The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it. There is no new >knowledge being produced. Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats. But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful. Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field. That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge even though I'm relying on stats to do it. jking

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel). Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters, and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups. Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye. Samuel is noted as an agressive free-swinger. Sabo has more homerun power. Both players started the game hitting below .200. There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later. But the game *was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.

I was there to see them face Baltimore and couldn't help but listen to the Boston fans talk about various players on the team. One guy was totally obliterating Boggs, how he sucks, etc.... I told him I was a Yankee fan and I'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back. He said a pile of sh*t. I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for Boston, but come on he's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed dimension to the Yanks. A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantly a teacher, ask Pat Kelly. I think he's got a few good years left in his bat and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League East this year. Boston fans have no class!!! They'll probably boo him like crazy his first time back in pinstripes and I hope he goes 4 for 4 and shuts them up.

If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball over ANY portion of the plate. Given that the ball is ~ 2.9 "" in diameter.

My >*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently >(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might >be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players >(as opposed to all baseball players). Let's be careful here. If players' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88). Just flipping a coin, you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get-- No. of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip (random) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin. Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years. Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years. In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year. If it was just a random process, you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5). Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein probably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher, but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage). This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually. A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin. (Self-serving plug follows: some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

What is the rule that qualifies > a pitcher as making a save? IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all of baseball. My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on-deck circle. Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot excede three runs. I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners/savers/etc. For instance, a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win. Has this pitcher earned a win, no way. I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score. Assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth. His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. The third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" satisfaction. Mike I bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce. >

Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time, arguably. Winfield has meant more to his team than Henderson. Unlike daryll, henderson tries hard. He is an amazing centerfielder. Rickey is VERY good, maybe better than winfield, I was angry at the dissing of winfield. Though Winfield has been better than henderson lately. Check the numbers, winfield may surprise you.

Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a "back-end" perfect game. How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games? The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and retired 26 straight after that.

I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience, Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away? Roger Healey

That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in 1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the only criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort of like the yanks in the 50s. Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career. Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all those rings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season. Steve Thornton stevet@eskimo.com

Remove the Balk rule. It is the runners responsibility to stay "safe" > no matter what the pitcher does. Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous. Consider the following scenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home, but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down. It is the balk rule that prevents this from happening. Believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA (Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario. I was the batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it. In the 12 years that I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw. -- Pablo Iglesias pi@ruth.ece.jhu.edu

The stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings) and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

Maybe Andres has a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the ball. Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins. For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save: He must finish the game and either 1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck. 2. have pitched at least three innings effectively. A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game. >I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in >determining winners/savers/etc. For instance, a pitcher can come in in the >ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in >the next half inning and earn the win.

For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So, there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer. If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save and Clemens would get the win.

Growing up in the early 1980's and playing 2 years of Mario Mendoza-esque Little League, I was told that since my hitting, well, sucked, I would do best to either "Walk, or take one in the face for the team". I did both. And, my Yankee fan father would say, "Bat like Oscar Gamble". So I did. And my career OBP was about .550.

That is *your* opinion that Sabo is "clearly a better hitter" than Samuel. The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season. Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted). This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more at bats. I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo. I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a hit. I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that situation than Sabo. >>If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you >>would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch- >>hitting Samuel.

I've seen a detailed study of >why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate. Nope. Sorry. But if you were interested in a reason why I expect Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could. If you were interested in a reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could. But you're not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population.

I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless. No better than a coin toss. I actually *do* accept your work. As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations, for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance. For that player. And Chris Sabo is one such player. >So tell me? Does the term fit? Or do you have an open mind? Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have an open mind.

[detailed explanation deleted..] Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance. Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win. Well, that's certainly true in Lotto. But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball. When you start down the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path. I repeat. I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance. I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance. And I think Chris Sabo is such a player. -- The Beastmaster -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. Clemens had a run-in at a bar.

But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody to move up a base. The ump's position: "it was still fair when it passed third base". Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage to advance one base safely. There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.

Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark. Personally, I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected. But that's why Cox did; it's called protecting your players. And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game, all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history. Even in the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field. And I'd have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the Braves did Fri. night. Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring outrageous postings. I will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will be some with other teams as well. I hope not. Eric

Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat. He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but he hasn't been shuttled around. I think he's been in New York ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I believe. I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot it around either. I think if Velarde is given a chance, he could become extremely productive. I don't have any stats to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has this year. He has 3 HR already. Same goes for Jim Leyrtiz. He has a big mouth, but he does get the job done when he concentrates. I think the situation with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing. I think he might have realized something when the Marlins or Rockies didn't select him. The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now. Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen? Ouch.

You're certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with the play. But the argument here is over what constitutes interference. You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted a definition of interference at all. IMO this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print in the rulebook. Something like: APPROVED RULING: If in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be judeged guilty of interference. or APPROVED RULING: The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball. -- In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered. -- Len Reed Holos Software, Inc.

Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude. It isn't that he's got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's (still) a total sucker for the curve ball. It looked for a while in 1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point. As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal: who knows? Batting Bonds, the team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2 hitters aren't exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren't giving much up there. And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that Bonds is, he seems better suited to the #3 spot. Assuming, of course, that he starts hitting one of these days... -- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Michael Zimmers | Voice: 408 996 1965 | | SoftHelp -- Suppliers to Software Developers | Data: 408 996 1974 | |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Has anybody done a >study to determine how much time is actually "wasted" -- say, in these A's >games? Oh, probably. Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for 1983 and 1992. (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols. Who knows? She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.) Those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*. Something is being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games by 15 minutes. Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches. Given the increasing specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me. If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back. Then I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules, which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones). The problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?" You don't seem to think it is at all. Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows? If the rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my mind. But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing, or else nothing will be changed.

That's the trouble: *what* peak years? He wavers between excellent and very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there. 1979 was a fine year; 78 and 80 were merely really good. With the Yankees, 84 (I think) was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA. Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either. He's been in the bigs since 1973, with a one-year intermission for surgery. Though he doesn't have the mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's not a natural hitter. Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building. But his sheer athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot. Fascinating player to watch, even now. Not obviously great in any one way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising levels. Roger

Runners may advance at own risk. (Gotta tag up if caught, etc.) It is not a force, and the pop was not caught, so regardless of whether the SS tags 3B or 2B (it wasn't clear, above), he hasn't got the runner out. |> (B) The umpires don't declare the infield fly rule and the third |> baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop, who |> tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and |> third. OUT. See rule 6.05(L) APPROVED RULING. (Below). In this case, the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule doesn't apply. (Sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the point). The batter is not out, so a force situation is created. Therefore, the runner is out. ( UNLESS, by rule 6.05(L) the ball is dead AND the batter is safe, then I guess the runners would advance unmolested. I can't really tell from 6.05(L) that the ball is dead in this situation.) |> |> What's the call in (A) and (B)? Pertinent rules: 2.00 Definition of Infield Fly: "When an Infield fly is called, runners may advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly rule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains in play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05(L). The Infield Fly rule takes precedence." 6.05(L) A batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid, or first,second and third base occupied before two are out. The ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases. APPROVED RULING: In this situation, the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground, except when the infield fly rule applies. -- Jim Dean (Internet: jimdean@bnr.ca) +-----+ National Capital Baseball League mild-mannered computer scientist -->|Phone|--> President.

By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. After all, any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't. Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence? Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division. If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the Series. Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting? If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games. In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed. While many of us are thinking things like "Base- runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like "It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today". The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players. Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field. After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it. Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player. Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays' victory? Probably, but how do you know? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won, perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto). Was Babe Ruth a good player? He played on some WS-winning teams, but did he have anything to do with their success? It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't. It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof. Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically and by looking at the rulebook. It is necessary to score more runs than one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one's opponent from scoring. Runs are scored while a team is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year. We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you. To make some flat predictions: Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than Gene Larkin this year. The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings. The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but will also give up more. I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you. As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given 3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random chance (and almost statistically significant). If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods, however fuzzy. > >It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally >meaningless. > So how about "real life"?

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have spouses either. Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST. (It was 7:35 last year, but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.) I go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum. Extra innings could put me well past midnight. Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all. If the next day is a workday, I may have to bag that as well. Further, the later the game goes, the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie. All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.

Now *this* is a legitimate point. Baseball is entertainment, and I have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others, regardless of their win-value. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the slug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out of it. I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun. Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga's inability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he "isn't paid to walk" or "is an RBI guy" or whatever. >And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw >their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike >to them, than because they have a great "eye" I'm not sure. I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becoming convinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot. Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot: Power No Power Patient Frank Thomas Brett Butler Barry Bonds Ozzie Smith Mark McGwire Craig Grebeck Babe Ruth Miller Huggins Ted Williams Billy Hamilton Rickey Henderson Eddie Joost Joe Morgan Mike Hargrove . . . . . . Impatient Ernie Banks Ozzie Guillen Dave Kingman Shawon Dunston Joe Carter Andres Thomas George Bell Jose Lind Kirby Puckett Devon White etc. As far as I can tell, all the categories are full. It really looks like the two are independent. Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at the plate, and yet he walks quite a lot. Part of that, undoubtedly, is being small of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of target at least 3 times out of 6. Randy Milligan is an even better example; he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all over the place, despite his huge strike zone. -- David M.

While I'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here. 1) Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls. So have pitchers and catchers. Usually, nothing happens. Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations. 2) It's not as if Gant was "in Hirschbeck's face". Gant said something about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away from Hirschbeck. As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but with a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box, if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch. And if I was really angry at the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed, especially at a key moment in the game. When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box. IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game. Gant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle. And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play. Gant resisted, as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and Hirschbeck called for the pitch. At that point, Cox came out on the field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the dugout. Cox was tossed "protecting his player". I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game. It's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game, Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play God on the field. Not good qualities for an umpire. I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future, in order to improve my sample size. IMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire.

We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good estimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and Morris? The differences are too great there. In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best", how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions, the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.) Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al. Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality of the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly) is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you do) Clay D.

A "reasonable" umpire would have realized that there was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth. What Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure. What a "normal" baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would have been ejected from the game. Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a conflict, was penalized for showing some restraint. Incidentally, a "reasonable" home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant requested. If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so upset. If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the appeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help. Finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called efforts to "speed up the game." The game was played very quickly, it was just at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays in the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than Deion having to clean garbage off the field). -- @econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke.edu fls@econ.duke. s To my correspondents: My email has been changed. e l My new address is: fls@econ.duke.edu d f If mail bounces, try fls@raphael.acpub.duke.edu u

(A subsidiary of LundyCo) Lines: 30 You want to speed up ballgames? 1. Enforce the two minutes between innings. As it is, many fields are allowing THREE minutes between them. Fifteen seconds before TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game. Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or a ball is called. 2. Don't grant time to batters just because they want it. They may get pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike. 3. Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current rule is too lenient), and then enforce it. Fifteen seconds is more than enough time. If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball, and restart the clock. Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours in the AL. That's just too damn long.

(-: Invariably, all the arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the same thing: the games are too long and too boring. Baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal. If you look at it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games. The difference is that there is "more action" in that duration in football games. Perhaps if there were "more action" in baseball games, you would get more of those fans to tune in.

Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00 for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston, plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. I can't afford to go to a lot of games. Hence, going to a game is a big deal, like going to a play or an opera. Maybe you have more money than I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played. However, I don't like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going on in that game. I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason (Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage). I want to see the game, not people standing around. I don't really enjoy watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television, because they're busy showing you replays). I don't like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game (the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year, and they're going to a 35 second clock). There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person. For me, going to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not willing to make that often: the length of their games is costing the A's revenue from me.

From: sam@steamer.clam.com (Sam Mandelbaum) Subject: Yankee Thoughts Organization: CLaM Associates, Cambridge, MA 02141 Lines: 76 Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction. They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August. However, I would take back a few moves: 1. The Jim Abbott Trade. I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a great pitcher also. He could win the Cy Young this year, but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield isn't good enough. So why was this not a good trade? JT Snow. How many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the Angels? I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player. The Yanks should have kept him. What about Mattingly, you ask? Well - it's great that the Yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as before his back injury. It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take Snow over Mattingly at first. The Yanks also gave up two promising propects with Snow for Abbott. Besides, with Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects. I know Abbotts only 26, but this was too much to give up. I believe George forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that Abbott will be a big hit in NY. However, I'd like to see the Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show. 2. Wade Boggs. I live in Boston and like Wade a lot. But, his career is winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?). Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range. What a shame about Charlie Hayes, huh? 3. Spike Owen. See Wade Boggs. I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri or whoever. Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point. And these guys are on the down sides of their careers. 4. Danny Tartabull. Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. But he never is. We should expect 120 games max out of him. Meanwhile, Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing left field! I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder. What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year. They should (at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two. I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner. Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George. It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now. The veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like Boston did this year). Develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep them). Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect. I'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example). George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away. Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future. Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!

I don't think that it is "obvious" that "lots" of people are willing to pay the price. I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold. But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider what is happening on a team-by-team basis. When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources. One of the best sources may be ticket sales. Example 1: The Dodgers The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise prices without hindering revenues. I certainly think that is true. Example 2: The Padres They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year. If they raise prices, less. If they want to increase their overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a winning team on the field. But given that won't happen (it won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket prices and running frequent promotions. Will they do that? I have no idea. But they won't increase prices, because it won't work *for them*. >2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners > decrease ticket prices, that does not decrease the tv contract. The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place. Each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces. As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works.

I believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan. They encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study the catchers' signals, and so on. And almost every A's hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch. This is not, imo, a coincidence. This is planned. And I hate it. As for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays. But I do wonder. What if Gant had requested a time out?

From: barring@cs.washington.edu (David Barrington) Subject: Moe Berg Organization: Computer Science & Engineering, U. of Washington, Seattle Lines: 22 NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly garbled by me), an official historian for the CIA. She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing but which sounds good). She said that among other things, Berg was the principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic programs, because of his physics background and language skills. She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him). (I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program, but I don't know how reliable this is.) Unfortunately, NPR didn't mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it. (In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher. He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese. Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids, according to McCarthy.) Dave MB

I for one am glad to see this happen, (!!!!) I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that Gant should have listened to him. However, what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games. You are the first person ( non-mediot ) I have seen endorse this policy. I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers ) bitching about it. I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting "Hurry up!" If I cough up big bucks for a ticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10. I really don't understand it. Games are longer now for several reasons: more pitching changes, more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy showboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter's box. My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel bar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar. Sure they want the game over with. Print journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games: they have deadlines. The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - they constantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late when the game goes longer than 2:30. Maybe I am just a ne'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you. As a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year. The increased offense thus far will certainly spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly. Nick Flynn

Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk: 75% of the time he made an out. 10% of the time he hit a single. 5% of the time he hit a double. 10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4?

I've combined those with my position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year. We can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the MVP award. Major caveats: these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies. The offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair. Finally, we still don't know what to do about catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts. Having said that, there are still some surprises. Let's look National League first. All numbers in total runs contributed over the season. Player Offense Defense Total Sandberg 44 32 76 Bonds 67 3 70 Walker 26 26 52 Justice 14 33 47 Daulton 44 ?? 44+? Larkin 36 4 40 Grace 13 27 40 As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season. If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you get essentially a dead heat. Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case. Darren Daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference, and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible. A good case could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude. My personal vote: Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice. In the American League: Player Offense Defense Total Ventura 22 34 56 Martinez 47 -1 46 B. Anderson 21 25 46 Thomas 47 -5 42 R. Henderson 25 16 41 Raines 17 23 40 Tettleton 33 ?? 33+? OK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top player in the AL last year? I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time arguing against him at this point. Yes, I know these numbers are only approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy. Also, those of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds. Once again, there's a catcher in the ointment. If calling a game is as important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away). TAke a guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that. My personal vote (excluding pitchers): Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson. I'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher leverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense. For the record: Carlos Baerga 27 5 32 Roberto Alomar 35 -2 33 Forget it; it's a wash. Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding Don Mattingly's defense this past season. Don recovered brilliantly from his weak '90 and '91 to end up with Mattingly -1 17 16 runs which is clearly an above-average first baseman. However, it's still 18 runs behind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John Olerud. On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned. -- David M.

From: barring@cs.washington.edu (David Barrington) Subject: Red Sox Choke Contest Organization: Computer Science & Engineering, U. of Washington, Seattle Lines: 21 To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current heights. You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year. Then you must predict either: (1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or (2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year. So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you were serious, Val!). ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.

And yes, >baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball. The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches. And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don't become extra-long. Quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better.

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due. It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly). Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save the bullpen every fifth day. If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series. His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games. I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit. He pitched only as good as he needed to be. When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out" (I hate this expression!). An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball. By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra (I hate this too!) when the game was on the line. Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history to suit the present. BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed? > > From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll > settle for good enough and the ring :-) ditto! > > Joe Leonard > jle@world.std.com > eddie

If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5) without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base as if walked.

I really think that this is the key point. When I saw the incident on Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate Gant went. Then he casually leaned against his bat.

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around, Gant wasn't ordered back in the box "sooner", he was ordered back immediately. As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box. Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches. The only reason he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call. I expect his concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as possible. Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring drought. Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there. You know the umpire is going to do something (call for a strike, throw you out, etc.). Gant was wrong. But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view. Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem. Gant had a reason to want some time (disputed strike call). Gant hadn't been wasting time all game. The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old. The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position. Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little slack? For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key situation. Did he have a date to get to? And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game. -- Dale J.

Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me. The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right. In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is "Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have: Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271) in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh. So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding. Total RAR (bat/field) 1. Bonds 152 (124/28) Ventura 124 (66/58) 2. Sandberg 143 (88/55) Thomas 122 (110/12) 3.

So the "No Power/Impatient" guys have no excuse. The "No Power/Patient" guys are doing the right thing. Now the "Impatient/Power" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?). Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches? Perhaps, but I doubt it. If you tell Joe Carter to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive. The "Patient/Power" guys? Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" so they get their walks based on the small zone. Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams. Wow! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them. The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.

The rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification, so it's possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner, then again we have interference. You know, it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly--if the catcher (or the pitcher, say Rob Dibble, for example) throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline, the fielder takes the chance of being ejected. Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or (your scenario) above him. You should note that in our American Legion League, (which uses MLB rules) we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference per rule 7.09. RStimets

One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers. What does it say ?? ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game. Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA is 3.00. To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9. ERA = (ER/IP) * 9 An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error. More specifically, if an error occurs that represented the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs. Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game. Here are some examples: If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. If an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after this error and NOT counted as earned runs. If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who were left on base. If the those runners who were left on base score, and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game. I hope this explains things for you.

I remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.

Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing enough walks. What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team". If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), *THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks?

The lengthier games >are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking >longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers >and pitching coaches. > Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football. Last year I hardly watched a game. What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game. A team scores. 2.5 minutes of commercials. Kickoff. 1.5 minutes of commercials. Three downs and a punt. 2 minutes of commercials. AAAAARRRRGH! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I believe institutionalize slow play. I don't mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first; in fact, I rather enjoy it. Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first. What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first, or when the game is a blowout. I don't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration. What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game. When the delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the commercial breaks in football. I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up" the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster. That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game. It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans. Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch. I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out. I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present. I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball. On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do. I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting there. -- The Beastmaster -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson) Subject: Hits Stolen -- Centerfield 1992 Summary: DCON and DOPS for leftfielders Keywords: defense center Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 118 Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made." OK, I realize that's unfair. Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.

From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson) Subject: Hits Stolen -- Left Field 1992 Keywords: defense left Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 105 Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kevin Bass would not have made." OK, I realize that's unfair. Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.

To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year: Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and prevented 11 doubles.

The score is now 7-5, with XXX's team still on top. I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win." If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch. Needs more seasoning. Send him to AAA.

If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5) without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base as if walked. This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably. Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off attempts. The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base, given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time.

Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement. If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris. If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference. If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola. >Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the >other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, >Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly). Yes. You can make the argument that the his presence prevented the team from collapsing in August. >Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save >the bullpen every fifth day.

What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him. Mostly, this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better the rest of the way. That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the team's credit. Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done this in previous years. In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992. Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in. Typical Morris games. Morris gets behind; team rescues him. He's not responsible for that rescue. And in both those games, the team just didn't rescue him enough. Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't earn him a victory. >BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a >veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more >can he be embarrassed? Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen. Greg

And he pitched many not-so-outstanding ballgames, too. Jack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year. This certainly isn't irrelevant, and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality the Blue Jays might not win. Re leadership, I don't see it. If the leadership effect is there for a starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on the pitching staff. You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve. Instead, the rest of the staff declined. You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership; the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous year.

I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out. First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present). How many Cy Youngs does Morris have? How many Cy youngs does Clemens have? Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park. Detroit, hugh hitters paradise. Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold. If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris snaps the ball, and throw for Ks. Otherwise, he just tries to get people out. As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to when he doesn't pitch. How bad would the Red sox have been last year without him? Can you say 92 Phillies? I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi great tenacity. Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen, but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc. Paul sparks

There is a fine line between "getting players' input" and "knuckling under to players' demands." A manager, much like a military officer, needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during a game. After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) ) Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like demands. I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm used to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry. Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying, "I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role." (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.) That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?" A more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he is doing. If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I am all for it." We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant. Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted, except for personal stats. If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that question, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get paid for RBIs. I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team." or something like that. It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was hitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player. Since Strawberry will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free. Remember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hit fourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it is true. --Jeff

After the official scorer balances the official score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people.

The box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services. If there are corrections, those are issued later.

Minor point: Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant. The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972). The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium. The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s). Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets). So the deal was worked out. >Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football >stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, >because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the >action.

(the south bend white sox actually do this). violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing brawl". EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand, stand, stand. look, look, look. ho, hum. then, the bullpens come running in. when they reach the "fight", they just stand there, too. anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined. further, the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield. football: sex, violence. basketball: sex, violence. hockey: violence. baseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn. bob vesterman.

Klapisch wrote the book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the papers. I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof that a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (let alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not Shea. For those people who do not know what the press is like in New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about any other part of the U.S. Keith Hernandez said it very well on ESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a game. I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but I do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb up a news story, even if there isn't one there. Now as far as the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almost totally blame Bonilla. No matter what a member of the press does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist. Personally, I always thought that a beat writer that always follows a club around should report the news, but not be looking to degrade a team. I don't know whether to blame Klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in New York.

From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson) Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992 Summary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen Keywords: second defense Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 117 Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made." OK, I realize that's unfair. Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article. The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases -- Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone. My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL? Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris? He looks like a really good one. Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine. Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.) I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox. -- Doug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu : Me, age 4 & now: "Mommys and Daddys & other Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it? : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!" 
From: rstimets@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (robert and stimets) Subject: Reds snap 5-game losing streak: RedReport 4-18 Keywords: Finally Nntp-Posting-Host: silver.ucs.indiana.edu Organization: Indiana University Lines: 136 Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense. Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth. He had only given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman. Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short. Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he should know better than that). Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed. The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer. Pugh must have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured: Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze. They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??) The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game. After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell. Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center. A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally. Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily. With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season. Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities. The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three. Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth. I'll take it, though. The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc. And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them. That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting. There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching. At least, to me. I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order. I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end. Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year. And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across. I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results I would love to see that. -- Doug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu : Me, age 4 & now: "Mommys and Daddys & other Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it? : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"

From: kkeach@pomona.claremont.edu Subject: three homer games and Padres notes Reply-To: kkeach@pomona.claremont.edu Organization: Pomona College Lines: 36 To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the Cards and the Yanks. He hit three 6 times. I am almost sure about this. In case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe Ruth and is 72. Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan Gonzalez. He has at least three games with three and maybe 4. I know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie. I don't have any record books at college for me to check on though. Please let me know, okay, if I am wrong. Onto the Padres. Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news? I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I can't get McPaper consistently around here. comment: It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres. It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann. Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average. Bell always could finish with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers. leadoff comment: Craig Shipley?????? I get on base 29% of the time if I'm lucky at leadoff? Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn. He's got 4 steals already. Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though? I haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores. Anyway unless you are going to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn. He at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases. Sheffield comment: Though the season is early and stats mean nothing. Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently. But does Sheffield have an injury, or anythingelse wrong with him. I just don't hear anything. Andy Benes: Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91? or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then? Has anyone seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, Sunday april 18: Padres 10, St Louis 6. Padres sweep the Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer. Sheffield and Tueful also homer in a winning cause. Thanks for listening-reading any comments???? Kelly Keach kkeach@pomona.claremont.edu

From: Mamatha Devineni Ratnam <mr47+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Zane!!Rescue us from Simmons!! Organization: Post Office, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 77 NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.edu So far Simmons looks like a total idiot. 1) Zane Smith should learn how to "switchpitch" and return from the DL. I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all. 2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right. 3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year. 4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract. 5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year. 6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead. 8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that. 9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely. 11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field. 12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad. 14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will. On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> -Pravin Ratnam

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis. Such thoughts affected her hiring practices. Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story. Furthermore, he is merely an athlete. He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do. Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea. He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball. Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension. In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous. As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game. Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts. -Sean ******************************************************************************* "Behind the bag!" - Vin Scully *******************************************************************************

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season. The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers. However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it. In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay. However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game. The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have? Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing. However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters? I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters. I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's. However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season. I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties. Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth. The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied. Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins. The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins. Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers. Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF. They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers. I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games. Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching. They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too. *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth. But I think third or fourth place is more likely.

I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire. But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her either. The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other. Umpires have to be extremely tough people.

From: pcaster@mizar.usc.edu (Dodger) Subject: Re: Dodger Question Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Lines: 31 Distribution: usa NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching. So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders. Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done. If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively. Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff. Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years. Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year. And Piazza has also been great on defense. He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first. Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense. But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs. But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs. Dodger

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion from the rest of the team's. There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball. And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game. Each game determines which *team* is the best that day. At the end of the season, the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division. The playoffs determine the best of the best. But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*. Not the individual players. There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game. To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely that player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup. Sheer speculation. Impossible to ascertain. If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria, then fine. But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of base- ball. So until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of Clemens is totally sub- jective and is mere opinion. I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon. >The fact is that Morris didn't "win" any ballgames, Toronto did, in >spite of Morris' "contribution". This has been explained to you Exactly. The Jays won with Morris pitching. And Boston wins with Clemens pitching. I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about. >many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it. You don't have to be rude. >You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy. For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi. I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings (although I have, tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past). I am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual's performance from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance. The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it. There is no new knowledge being produced. So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds. -- cordially, as always, maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca "So many morons... rm ...and so little time."

However, although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being "fireballs, hot blooded, flashy". The report also emphasised that despite the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons, baseball has actually done much better by black players than Hispanic players. Another interesting point was the language barrier problem. The reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his book, _All The Pretty Horses_. Yet, few MLB organizations employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being the Oakland A's. Another point: Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood. Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until playing ball in the US. Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson, as many "light black" or "brown", Latin Americans were incorporated into baseball. /S -- "I did not know the cure for the disease ------------------- of images, but I believed in the healing | Sandra Vigil | power of words and stories." | vigil@esca.com | - Until the End of the World -------------------

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask. >>Don't give me that shit.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16. Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

But you cannot know how the team >would have done without Viola. Your analysis is fallacious. OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger: Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please. For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the "Red Jays" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that "had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off." >It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out >here in the real world guys.

Here are some of my observations: Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more measured. Be that as it may.... >1. Roger and Frank are in vintage form, and the Sox are rresponding to them. Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola. >2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries. This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though. >3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him. How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher. >4. Russell is finishing well. In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July? >5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter. A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year. >6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field >and just as good at the plate) Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the "in the field" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better). >If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now) >and hit like they are so far, they coiuld run away with thee division. but >since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge >of running away with the division, I think that they win be over .500 and at >least Third if not Second or First. See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like "could run away with the division" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

But the pitcher is 80% of the defense. The primary role of every other player is on offense. Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game. (They might not do much with their part of the offense, but that's another issue.) That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF. They hit pretty well in addition to their defense.

Lowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana's only representative to the major leagues. Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish. Between Stone, Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach, that's quite a starting rotation. Moe Berg can catch. Harry Steinfeldt, the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield. Is Stanky Jewish? Or is that just a "Dave Cohen" kinda misinterpretation?

(No offense, > Gordon). I wouldn't give baserunning that much value. The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well. If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third. Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar's. (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.) Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams. No team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others. Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams. Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example. They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing. Yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by Runs Created. -- David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu "We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary."

He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300 while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero, and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows? For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5 million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age of Yankee domination.

Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society Distribution: na Lines: 50 Was going over some videos last night..... Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting. And enlightening. Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986. 1. He's bulked up too much. Period. He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds, not gain more bulk. 2. His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED. Conservatively, I'd say he's lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed. 3. That open stance is KILLING him. Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is released. Downing could do this without significant head movement - Canseco can't. Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes, they're fully closed. Without a good starting point, it's hard to make adjustments in your swing. What would I do, if I were Jose? Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing. First, minimize movement before the swing. Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing. Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely. Second, drop 20 pounds. Cut out the weight work. Third, relax the wrists. Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives. His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park. If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years. If not, he could still hit 600+ HR. -- * Gary Huckabay * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?" * * "Movie Rights * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir, * * available thru * I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch! It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark. In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game with California was cancelled. --salty

I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame. >2.

It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch. >First, minimize movement before the swing.

The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much. I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits.

OK, they have some decent pitchers.

And it isn't because I loathe the Philly sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems: 1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20 minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score being reported on WIP. 2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence. The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles. Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle. -Alan

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst. However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average. So who would be better? Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs. Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs. Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays). Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs. Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs. Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a different SS. Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however? Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not. I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall. -- Dale J.

Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact the authorities!

RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run.

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame. Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration. Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman. Darrell Evans - No. Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years. Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first. |> |> Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody |> giving |> |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, |> marginal. |> |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there.

I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player. |> Let's be a little more selective, huh?

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name. Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately. Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes. So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go. Yes - Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.

Something else to consider: Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424 and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park. I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P rated Baerga higher, actually.

His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody. Part of that may be his mobility. 1988 was with the Yankees. 1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield. 1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third. >Williams, Matt ---- ---- .633 .653 .656 0.647 Add another to the elite fielders list. >Caminiti, Ken ---- .675 .630 .653 .596 0.642 >Sabo, Chris .751 .626 .616 .613 .575 0.642 Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value. I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke. Sabo is merely average, however. His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot. >Buechele, Steve .647 .616 .647 .681 .599 0.635 Strange last two years. >Schmidt, Mike .628 ---- ---- ---- ---- 0.628 According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average. (Average in 1988 was .643). >Boggs, Wade .643 .659 .550 .653 .634 0.626 Boggs has been pretty good. I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit. >Martinez, Egdar ---- ---- .621 .645 .599 0.624 Last year -- a fluke or a portent? >*NL Average* .643 .625 .602 .623 .603 0.619 >Seitzer, Kevin .654 .583 .593 ---- .635 0.616 >*AL Average* .641 .612 .604 .620 .602 0.615 Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?

I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding. He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third. >Zeile, Todd ---- ---- ---- .614 .593 0.605 Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder. Each year he's about 10 points below average. And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this. >Baerga, Carlos ---- ---- ---- .604 ---- 0.604 Moving back to second was a good idea. >Hayes, Chris ---- .601 .622 .606 .574 0.602 So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?

To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990). Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove. >Hollins, Dave ---- ---- ---- ---- .577 0.577 Good hitter, but his fielding needs work. >Sheffield, Gary ---- ---- .584 ---- .567 0.575 Not a good fielder. >Blauser, Jeff ---- .573 ---- ---- ---- 0.573 >Fryman, Travis ---- ---- ---- .571 ---- 0.571 Both are better off at shortstop. >Gomez, Lee ---- ---- ---- .551 .542 0.546 Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.

The only category that I see which shows an advantage >for Alomar is OBP Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and beat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors, a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way. People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs, Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al. Gord Niguma (fav player: John Olerud)

I'd be willing to make two wagers: 1) Snow doesn't win ROY. 2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years. I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a player, and he is on a losing team. I'm skeptical of the second because of his back. Mattingly is 32 this year, and how many players play until they are 40? Not too many, and most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer) To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention. In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it. While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby Grich, and Bob Johnson. Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the top of the N.L. standings: W L GB Philadelphia 79 51 - Cincinnati 74 57 5 1/2 St. Louis 72 59 7 1/2 San Francisco 73 60 7 1/2 This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies' season: Date Score Opponent Lead Pitcher (starting and winner/loser) 9/1 4-3 Houston 5 1/2 Bunning (15-4) 9/2 2-1 Houston 5 1/2 Short (15-7) 9/3 0-6 Houston 5 1/2 Bennett (9-12) 9/4 5-3 San Francisco 6 1/2 Mahaffey; Baldschun (6-5) 9/5 ??Win San Francisco 6 1/2 Bunning (16-4) 9/6 3-4 San Francisco 5 1/2 Short; Baldschun (6-6) 9/7 5-1 Los Angeles Bennett (10-12) 1-3 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Wise (5-3) 9/8 2-3 Los Angeles 6 Mahaffey (12-7) 9/9 5-10/11 St. Louis 5 Bunning; Baldschun (6-7) (Cardinals take over 2nd place from Cincinnati) 9/10 5-1 St. Louis 6 Short (16-7) 9/11 1-0 San Francisco 6 Bennett (11-12) 9/12 1-9 San Francisco 6 Mahaffey (12-8) (Giants move into a tie for 2nd with St. Louis) 9/13 4-1/10 San Francisco 6 Bunning (17-4) (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place) 9/14 4-1 Houston 6 1/2 Short (17-7) 9/15 1-0 Houston 6 Bennett (12-12) 9/16 5-6 Houston 6 Bunning (17-5) 9/17 4-3 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Wise; Schantz (2-4) 9/18 3-4 Los Angeles 6 Short; Baldschun (6-8) 9/19 3-4/16 Los Angeles 5 1/2 Bennett; Baldschun (6-9) 9/20 3-2 Los Angeles 6 1/2 Bunning (18-5) (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals) Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ... 9/21 0-1 Cincinnati 5 1/2 Mahaffey (12-9) (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place) 9/22 2-9 Cincinnati 4 1/2 Short (17-8) 9/23 4-6 Cincinnati 3 1/2 Bennett (12-13) 9/24 3-5 Milwaukee 3 Bunning (18-6) 9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee 1 1/2 Short; Boozer (3-4) (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th) 9/26 4-6 Milwaukee 1/2 Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5) 9/27 8-14 Milwaukee -1 Bunning (18-7) (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st, Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd) 9/28 1-5 St. Louis -1 1/2 Short(17-9) (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd) 9/29 2-4 St. Louis -1 1/2 Bennett (12-14) (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st) 9/30 5-8 St. Louis -2 1/2 Bunning (18-8) (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds) 10/1 4-3 Cincinnati -1 1/2 Short; Roebuck (5-3) (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game) 10/2 Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back 10/3 10-0 Cincinnati -1 Bunning (19-8) (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies) Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were: W L GB St. Louis 93 69 - Philadelphia 92 70 1 Cincinnati 92 70 1 San Francisco 90 72 3 Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch. ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610

As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird. But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw? I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball. Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb). He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand). With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction. One more thing, one game does not make a season. Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance. The A's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that's a paraphrase of what I remember). In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power. >Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, >so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players. Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game. Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in. These simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's offensive contribution to the team's runs scored. Thank you for making our case. Have a nice day. Greg

I hear the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it. Of those three, WIP has the best hosts hands down. Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is Jody Mac. WTEM is too generic to be placed in the catergory. In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the theme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so! WIP is totally original.

Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park. Not necessarily. It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example). I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter. >I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now.

Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball. Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year. Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. Greg

I think they are a second-division team. They should finish ahead of the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics. But I don't think they'll be above .500. (I think the East is stronger this year.) Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible. This year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad. Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in Abbott. Sanderson? Farrell? I don't believe it. And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their offense lacks punch. They don't have any bona fide power hitters. (Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis? None with more than 20 HR potential.) Cheers, -Valentine P.S. Which AL team had the most steals last week? Those go-go Tigers!

From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer) Subject: Darrrrrrrrryl Organization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest) Lines: 64 The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet. Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run. He stroked a line drive into the right field corner. The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd. Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball. A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball. Home run. Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's. Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry. What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing. He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch. That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man. All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game. Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch. Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area. In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss. Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning. L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch. Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play. Was the fan wrong? Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference? Or was he human and just reacting? By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible. Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games. I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line. Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball. But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan. -- The Beastmaster -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com 
From: pcaster@mizar.usc.edu (Dodger) Subject: Gross Grosses Out Dodger Fans AGAIN. Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Lines: 60 NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night. Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home. Another single made the score 2-0 Cards. Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third! Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster. Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman. By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2. The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays. Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc. Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield. The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second. Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third. My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen. Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over. Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen. The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday. Gross lived up to his name. He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded. After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards. Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run. The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that. Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth. He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount. Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza. If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors. Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year. The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits. Dodger

Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed. >Now.

The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, and >he probably won't being a reserve with the big club. Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as "TWG" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, "We have solid guys, we don't need to improve." You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW. Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast. "Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game. So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule: If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game. Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster catchers. The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher. Ken

I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home last year. Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the "Diamond" is built, Home runs are a rarity. In fact, Ron Gant, Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in Richmond. When they were sent to the majors, they never came back. If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere. So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming. Too many expectations I guess.

To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme. In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon: I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round. Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story. I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host. 12 Noon to 2 PM: At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks. I just think JM has the ability to transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base. This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts. I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin. If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes. 2PM to 4PM: This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties. Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports. MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate. Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious. 4 PM to 7 PM: MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli. I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks. I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now. I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason. That is why I give the advantage to FAN. 7 PM to Midnight: S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb. This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball. If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose. Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP. Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

(which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect either.

Especially when it comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer. As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say: The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both. To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'. This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net. A true fan of a team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right. Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86. Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower. The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them. Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of detracters come from all over. So what! Let them play and we will see what happens come September. The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets? Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore. Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball. Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games. =============================================================================== | joec@godot.cyprs.rain.com |WARNING: Elvis impersonating can be hazardous| | joec@ursula.ee.pdx.edu | to your health -- it sure won't help| | | your reputation. | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | I bike, therefore I am! | Go Red Sox!

From: hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu (Harold_Brooks) Subject: RBI, RISP, and SLG Organization: Bill's Safety Cab and Record Bar, Chickasha, OK Lines: 49 Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with. In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs. This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it. So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP. I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990. (I don't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.) If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP. The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level. So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level. I've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly). I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year. It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie. The results: RBI-HR Years Actual Predicted Carter (84-88,90) 400 402.6 Clark (87,88,90,92) 269 269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90) 471 460.8 Smith (84-88,90) 317 280.6 I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Also the Mets (my other least favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight. Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs. Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year). I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies. The media and all the Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings. Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we'll see who is in first then. I believe the Cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference. On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense. He was asked where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied "Fair." I remember it being in the "They Said It" section of Sports Illustrated. I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in. GO REDBIRDS!! Gary Wieman

But I'd like to differ with your opinion about "a city which is likely to pour in the votes...". I attended many games last year during the balloting. I know that a great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.

The argument was 1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%. 3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year? Yes, I know he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.

The runner can leave his base at any time. If the ball is caught, he's got to tag up. If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at all. So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up. If it isn't caught, he's probably scored a run. If it is, he's probably headed for AAA. The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out, thereby removing the force on the runners on base. All other rules apply, as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up. -- Tim Shippert shippert@cco.caltech.edu "If we are going to stick to this damned quantum-jumping, then I regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum theory." -E.

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin. 50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging. That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find. I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense. I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life. He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow. Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook. In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position. If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF. In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White. -- * Gary Huckabay * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?" * * "Movie Rights * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir, * * available thru * I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

No question about it. Daryl missed the ball, *then* the fan caught it. Daryl is so tall that he had the first shot at the ball. Daryl's just whining again.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late). It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well. I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's. The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds. There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better. Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year. Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth. I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching. For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out. So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces. Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, "I don't want a repeat of that near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work." Steve Howe, whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the Royals win it, 6-5. What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together, Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once.

I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better. These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just like he used to tell his checkers, "If the customers don't come back, I don't need as many checkers". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public. I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "Go to the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help". All in all, it was a fun day -- Craig Eid e-mail address craige@hpsad.sad.hp.com

The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury in 1988. His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989. He was still with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both offensive and defensive), he never has come back to his pre-injury level. Brendan

But there are two, that I saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!). 1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981. It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter. Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen. Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP, Lee would have been a safe bet. He wasn't even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into Montreal. The blast wasn't the important aspect. It was the timing. Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th. The Expos almost came back though... 2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980. So close, yet, so far. and 3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of years ago. It went off the technical ring in the Big O. It almost left the stadium!

His .632 DA wasn't out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average in 1988. But check out the last three years at the Metrodome. 1990 Gaetti .655 AL Avg .604 1991 Pags .744 Leius .653 Al Avg .620 1992 Leius .680 AL Avg .603 For the last three years, the highest DAs in either league have been posted by Minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (Pags) who was mediocre to horrible elsewhere. That doesn't *prove* a park effect is at work, any more than San Diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect is at work. But it looks like a strong possibility to me.

Uh, oh. I don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on >edge - I'd never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows? Does To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner. He has brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros. I don't think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball. McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses. He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club. Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well.. The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters. We're dealing with a young Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role. The only threat is the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen. --- --- --- --- --- --- David S.

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield, etc. are in the top 1%. Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability throughout most of his career. Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know what you mean. As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'? That's what a lot of voters tend to look at. And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't lead MLB history in walks allowed, either. Roger

As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important. As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible. As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close. I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field. Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not. Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win. Daniel daniel@caldera.usc.edu

The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle. What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. There's just no one there.

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win. Consider the Red Sox game last night. The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th. Who won the game? -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning. Looks like a team effort to me! Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win. How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game. Without either one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly. Not much of a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first! (Hill's lack of defense helped.) Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs. But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning! And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson? Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs. Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper? Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out! Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous. You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better. At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers. No other business could ever get away with the 19th century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs. I guess the owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans.

In fact, >it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy. I agree and disagree. John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses. While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something. I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs. Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games. Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is. >Consider an example: Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first; >about .12 on your scale. He does the same thing again in the fourth, with >the score tied, for another .14. And again, in the seventh, with the score >tied, for another .22.

So Fred and Bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME. There's clearly a problem here. The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has. First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game. Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning. That is a player who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game. Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one. Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game. Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives. >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark. Closers are enormously important. The total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough. > >In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right? No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size. I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning. And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out. It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning. Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games. On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win. The offence has many more outs to do something about. But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either. If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth. >Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball. What >you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >Does this make sense? No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made. Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball. And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the team would win. From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness. But, it really does not. Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down. I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance. There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness. Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example. We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses. How do we evaluate relief pitchers? Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.) Both had exceptional numbers. John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man. Who was more valuble to their team? Probably John. Who was the better pitcher? They were probably about the same.

Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89). On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.

I thought I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. I splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K. I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them. The total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.

From: dxf12@po.CWRU.Edu (Douglas Fowler) Subject: (ATAS) N.L. games 8/2-8/5 & standings of all Article-I.D.: usenet.1pqf84$caf Organization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA) Lines: 237 NNTP-Posting-Host: slc12.ins.cwru.edu Philadelphia at Chicago: Teams tied for 1st after Sunday Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series. One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. "What could be better," declared Ernie Banks. Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging? "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announced Ryne Sandberg. "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win. "Lord, I hope we pull it off." The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second. Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third. Rose went to second on the play. Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third. Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them. Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year. Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center. "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring. Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat. "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total. It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace. The picthers have slumped at times." So came the analysis from Frank Chance. The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run. In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1. Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third. Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit. Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third. Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered. Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter. Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning. The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies. Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday. To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third. Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty. Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs. Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings. The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph. Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts. Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win. Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth. The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done. After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season. Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday. However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2. "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed," remarked Lou Brock. "I don't see why we can't win this division." The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them. Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. ------------------------------------------------------------------- New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th! "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series. Keith Hernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins." The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers. Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams. Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense. When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark. They had been unable to several times in the past month. Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game. Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates. The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second. With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit. The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter. Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second. He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon. Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning. Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win. The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------ San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire. In fact, reported manager John McGraw, "once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while." Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1. Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits. Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest. The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each. The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record. They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though. Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth. He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh. Joe McGinnity earned the save. In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3. The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. ------------------------------------------------------------------- San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5): Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good. With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better. McGriff's batting average was even rising. Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up. Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3. McGriff launched two home runs. Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score. Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing. The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth. Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning. Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around. Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win. The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds. Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5): Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome. The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale. "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them. I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't afford to let the Astros beat us." He then winked and said: "Well, maybe Davis will get decked once." The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season. The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples. Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers. For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs. The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet. "It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs'," remarked Roy Campanella. The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager. After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch. He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning. They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4. They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game. "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained. "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered. "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run. Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws. We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time." The plan almost worked. Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third. 3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save. The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win. Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough. "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey. "Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then. We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome. I guess that's why they're so successful there." Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome. The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Article-I.D.: hydra.91513 Distribution: usa Organization: Georgia Institute of Technology Lines: 39 Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries. I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him. Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-) Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth. FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928) = $80,000 x (1.04)^65 = just over $1,000,000. Assuming inflation is average of around 5%. FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65 = almost 2,000,000. (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand). These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly overpaid. The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now. Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t think I'm off by much.

Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do. I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision. While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't. I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made. I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training. I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made. It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers. Sure, it may be conservative. It may also be logical. I don't know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me. -- The Beastmaster -- Mark Singer mss@netcom.com

When he first mentioned it, I thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over. And then in the examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded. So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.

The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start Williams B in CF. I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt "might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience. The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the Jays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play. That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs. He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.

It sounds like you're suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella. >Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, >expected to be among the best ever in baseball.

He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem. >The Braves options are Berryhill and Olson.

But both the Braves' catchers are very >good defensively (calling a game, blocking the plate, throwing) >and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively, they play on a team >that is not so much in need of another big bat. I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative. -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu New .. quotes out of context!

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things. For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

From: tek2q@Virginia.EDU ("Todd Karlin") Subject: New Uniforms Organization: University of Virginia Lines: 22 Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible. Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms. I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds. The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey. To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo. Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray. The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.

First of all how could he start Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball. A dishard Cub fan

Still, the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year. Huh? IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues. In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some increase will be seen. He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated. It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs). Or do they? What is "equivalent average?" One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers. Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway. But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples. So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park. > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Not even close. > He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his > baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. > That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The > media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a > good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best > hitter in the majors. I'd put him about there too. Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much. I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball. He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning. Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others). We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc. Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error." Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley). This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did. It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on. But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players. One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball. Their backgrounds are similar. What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background? Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly? It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art). I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. "Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say. Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon. It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville. Then again, it might not. Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's. But you guys DON'T KNOW. What's worse, you don't know that you don't. And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again. You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal. It's not. It's got some error. Oh well. Bill Guilford still thinks "hairy butt is truly ugly" might be right

I might as well say "We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4." >No. Maybe I need to improve my writing skills. Lopez, who is very >ordinary defensively, is not likely to hit so well at age 22 >(having not played at AAA level) that it is probably not a good idea >to rush him into the Braves lineup in 1993. Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well? He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did. By a lot. As for rushing... If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season? The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use. >>Lopez was hitting .588 over 17 AB when he was cut from spring >>training. What does he have to do to earn a chance?

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down "until he gets warmed up". >OK. Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.

But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds. Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either. >Now.

And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble. >Not superstars mind you, but solid, experienced veterans. Not superstars, not stars, not even good players. Maybe average, if we're being charitable. >The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the >outfield, an excellent platoon at first, a solid MVP candidate >at third and one of the better hitting shortstops. Ummm. Justice is a very fine hitter. Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell. Gant is a big question mark. The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in). Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop. >The center >field platoon will probably hit .300. However good Lopez' >bat *might* be (given the above) it won't be so much better than >what they have to offset the differential in experience and >defensive ability. Wanna bet? The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season. Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time. >The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, Just like Keith Mitchell did? >I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.

Lines: 15 Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0. Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get ready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR. In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating the Dodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wish them and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would be funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year. Dan Smith

(I don't remember a 30-day, but rather a 21-day. Anyways, it's gone now.) The period length is a minimum, not a maximum. You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want, IF he's still certified as injured. The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers). If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations. There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL. When there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists. --King "Sparky" Banaian |"No taxes: No new taxes, kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu |no old taxes, we are taxed Dept. of Economics, Pitzer College |enough." -- Rep.

Wait a minute. I missed something here. First, forget Keith Mitchell. Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors? If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't belong in the bigs? Now, Keith Mitchell. As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991. He did so well that he was returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all. Now his career is in jeopardy. So how does he fit in with your point. Good MLE's in AA. Moved him right to the big club. Now he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.

The Yankees were finishing 2nd to a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the Yankees had aged some from their peak years. Ruth and Gehrig couldn't play every position simultaneously. IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season, that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds have slightly passed their peak. Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees. After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series, both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the heroics of some old fart on the other team.

From: fierkelab@bchm.biochem.duke.edu (Eric Roush) Subject: Re: Young Catchers Article-I.D.: news.12799 Organization: Biochemistry Lines: 139 Nntp-Posting-Host: bruchner.biochem.duke.edu Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame! 1) Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily. Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June. And then Berryhill was dinged up. I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position. Before last season, he was the Braves "Defensive Catcher" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves "Offensive Catcher" prospect. Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful. But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets. I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back. 2) There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear. There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind). Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall). 3) Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also. What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration? Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible? Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known. From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL. 4) I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez. Of course,today we play the Cubs. Hopefully, we won't need him. ;) As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this: (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired) Cox: OK, we've sent Jones down. His fielding could be a little smoother. Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be. Schuerholz: Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too. Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract. We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense. Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet. Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez. That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995. Cox: Yep, that'll be nice. Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again. Now, what about Klesko? Schuerholz: Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream. If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera. I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM. First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark! If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings! Cox: OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon. Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait. Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be "persuaded" to act up. There's always the 15-day DL! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! Schuerholz: What about Caraballo? Cox: Well, he's not that much better than Lemke. Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more. Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks. Schuerholz: Now, let's see. That leaves Lopez. Cox: NOOOOO! I gotta keep Lopez! Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly. Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again? Schuerholz: Nope, Lopez has gotta go. You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration. May as well put it off that one extra year. Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him. Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter. You know how rare that is? Cox: Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer? Pretty common, if you ask me. I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series. PAT BORDERS!!! Schuerholz: Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup. Cox: Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon! Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff. He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good. Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate? Schuerholz: Yeah, but which stiff? Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May. Cox: OK, OK, you made your point. Keep them both. Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest. Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games! The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES! I'll be up there with John McGraw! Casey Stengel! Earl Weaver! Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell? I'll finally get my just reward! Mwa-ha-ha-ha! Schuerholz: Easy, Bobby. Have you been taking those "happy pills" left around by Chuck Tanner? Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow? Cox: Don't ask me; ask Ted. ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu "I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort" Grafitti, Paris, 1968 TANSTAAFL!

Lines: 74 I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how? First Base: Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs Second Base: Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge. Shortstop: Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even. Third Base: Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida. Catcher: Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins Left Field: Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year. Center: Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time. Right: Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs Starters: Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs Middle Relief: Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy. Closer: A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida. Overall, an edge to Chicago. Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course. e -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu GO CUBS!!! "One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball" - Geddy Lee

If you look at the picture of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked "NOT FOR BASEBALL", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.

I don't know. but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears/Zephyrs tenure in the American Association. Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games, all league games and the ratio. I found the same ratios for HR.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn't have access to). The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it. >>Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?

From: drw3l@delmarva.evsc.Virginia.EDU (David Robert Walker) Subject: Re: Young Catchers Organization: University of Virginia Lines: 70 Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to all: Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out. That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his "prime" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

Any reason given for this? Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts. Kevin

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for argument's sake, define "rushed" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing? I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any. I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats. (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers). Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career. Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season. He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed. However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since. It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being "rushed"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him. Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle. But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time. Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year. Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound. Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately. I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist. The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed. Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped. I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >>Braves for this year. >>Now. The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid >>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out >>runners. This is the crux of the argument (to me at least). Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present. You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt. But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher's rank in "defense". Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher? As far as I can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser). He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time. I can't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors! All we're left with is the calling the game aspect. Olsen and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff. But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers. How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff? The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine. Similarly, I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen. But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez. Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he can't learn just as well while in the majors?

The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

East Summary: The division has gone to the birds Keywords: last chance for foolishness Article-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466 Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 95 Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out. Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. AL East -- 1993 1. Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles? Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this: -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction. -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees -- Milwaukee was a fluke -- Indians aren't ready to contend -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of "replacement level" "But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you." No. As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate). But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles. "You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?" No. I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis. "Glenn Davis? That's insane". Yes. So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS: Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS: Segui may start. Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be the fifth starter. Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup. (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken? If you can't move Ripken out of the #3 spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction: "The Streak" continues. Harold Reynolds leads the team in caught stealing. 2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS: Abbot, Key, Perez. Could have best pitching in American League. Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS: Mattingly still considered best hitter. The Steinbrenner factor. (The Yankees lost to the Mets. Can wholesale changes be far behind?) Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction: Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS. 3. Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS: Management willing to make big deals. Management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. Olerud. Guzman. Alomar. WEAK POINTS: The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick. Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign). No one in the outfield can get on base. Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction: Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year. And have a losing record. 4. Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS: Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS: Molitor gone. Surhoff at third? Why? Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN: Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction: Surhoff won't finish the year at third. 5. Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS: Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS: Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts. Starts Felix Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction: Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break. 6. Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS: Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS: Most incompetent GM in baseball. Key free agent signing -- Andre Dawson. Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Clemens on the DL ObPrediction: Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon. Interpret that how you will :-> 7. Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS: Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS: If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year. Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better. This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN: Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN: Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction: Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs. One more division to go.... -- Dale J.

Of course that was because the balls used in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go on the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors. Of course Gregg "Wild Thing" Olson and Mike "Deserved a Cy Young" Mussina didn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that has something to do with it. Let's go O's! Why Not?

Derby) Expires: Fri, 30 Apr 1993 04:00:00 GMT Organization: Virginia Commonwealth University Keywords: MF Summary: Marlin fans Lines: 23 I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me. First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball. In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans. The second and most important was the fans. I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins. The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs. Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it, but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities. Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement. We'll find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond. Phillies are 2-0! (I better say it now before my opportunity passes by)

Derby) Expires: Sun, 25 Apr 1993 04:00:00 GMT Organization: Virginia Commonwealth University Lines: 14 I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East. It was also his career high 48th. Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the 1986 ALCS. The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run. That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in baseball. The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the WS against the Mets. Speaking of the METS, isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies?? The Astros have been painfully close twice I must admit.

I'd really like to know. BTW, Sherri, thanks for > the DA data I find it fascinating. Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented. Just as a penny saved is a penny earned. Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they won't need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF. This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison. Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter. It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs. The team that scores the most runs wins. This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves. They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent. The name of the games is to win. Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. Sam > > -Dave > > >>Sherri Nichols >>snichols@adobe.com >

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench. Gilkey hit over 300 last year, what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every team in the league. Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home, I can't take this anymore brian, a very distressed cardinal fan. -- Brian Landmann Georgia Institute of Technology Internet:gt7469a@prism.gatech.edu

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime. Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable. Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think. Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors. (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors. As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding. When he got to the majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher. It's not clear he ever learned to hit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture. BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

So what do you say? Don't you think he deserves it? I mean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it, as is Lee Smith (ha), then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon. Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, marginal. Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal. Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?  Steve

He's got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands. It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw. That seemed inexcusable in my book. BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation. On the replay, there's Dent waving him around.

Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of Fame. He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time and could throw hard. Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of losing seasons, lots of walks. No Cy Young awards. How does Nolan Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major League seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his teams games in 1972? He doesn't compare. Not even close. Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me. Give me 5 more seasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it.

Or Darrell >Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in >Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon. Oh, yeah. Dave Winfield--marginal player. Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power. Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter. Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range. Take a look at the stats: I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players. Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick. Eddie Murray? Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's. I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media. Lee Smith? Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close. He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (Wrigley, Fenway...). I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber. You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too. Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves. No way should HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO. Darrell Evans? Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er. > Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody >giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards, >marginal. Lemme ask you this. Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal? >Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both >shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal. >Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so >liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something Now, wait a goddamn minute here. Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop. His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves. Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career. Ozzie's offense, you ask? Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively. Yount? 3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff. His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go. He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO. >isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When >certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to >the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan? Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right. Garvey is a "mediot" candidate, pushed because of his "winning attitude" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his "great defense" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...). Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF. SkyJack? I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' "ability to win" which is nothing more than Morris' "ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs". At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned close to done.). But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams. While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites. Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF "consideration". Ryan? Of course, but be careful. I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about "Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time". After all, Nolan never won a Cy... Damn, he's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years... His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...) Puck? Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely). That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY tragic or sudden). He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league. I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it. And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in. But, really, it's too early to sell. This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it or not, I never tire of it. It's an interesting subject. Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team. I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up. I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees] Baltimore: Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)

San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake) [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)] E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bruce Hasch hasch@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu Sell the team, Eli!!

Lines: 36 NNTP-Posting-Host: vela.acs.oakland.edu Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago, the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights: R H E Oakland 2 9 0 Detroit 3 7 1 Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory. Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?). The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th. Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run. John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning. He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win. Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th. Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two. In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career. It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him. And what a way to get number 2,000!. Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say: WOOF! Go Tigers! --Randy

While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets. It was the first stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football. Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where, because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the action. The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have always hyped it as "beautiful Shea Stadium," a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is. Jay

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Ben's year. I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know. The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in) Baltimore New York Toronto Milwaukee Cleveland Boston Detroit (The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :).

My problems with the AEC are their (however inherent) continuous barage of misleading data in order to support the statement that nuclear is not only "safe and clean" but cheap to boot. 10 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour is not cheap and neither are nuclear power plants.

The number of people showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace. I doubt that it constitutes more than a handful of us. I'm queer, and I won't be there, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation. What the hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum number? Face it, people, we're everywhere. There are always more of us than you think. Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your children will grow up to join us. Hell, some of MY children may grow up to join us. The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear. We're not perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just like you--er, most of you. Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like. It won't do them one iota of good. Drewcifer P.S. I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are meaningful.

What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about "the right to association" ? Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much members of society as he is. As such they have the right to participate and have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals. No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would object also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associate with them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc), he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to equal access to opportunity. Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups with very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal commerce has a severe impact on their lives. Clayton, why exactly should your "right" to non-association in the public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity ? -- Tony Quirke, Wellington, New Zealand.

Why does this tenant have an "option" (I won't call it a right) to destroy the FOA of the landlord? If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they both can cease from using each other's property. Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on what basis does the FOA of the landlord "disappear"? It seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice. Well, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by golly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right. I don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights. >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about those quasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders. The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They can give you a list of all of their owners. They have no "anonymous", unknown to them, owners. >By the way, the above analysis is based on the assumption >that the right to freedom of association and the right to an >equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal >importance.

FOA can be derived by any two rational people, on a basis that neither has evil, malicious, or murderous intent towards the others. In short, agreement is mutual, or not at all. Your REO on the other hand, lives only by accepting coercion, the gun, into the situation. And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it is based only on might makes right.

Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in our German department and her uncle is a private practicioner in Saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance. While Canada organizes by province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices. But remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major German corporations. Germans have public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities (actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system, was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).

NOT an accurate analogy. David Koresh did not take a bunch of hostages and then call the BATF with a ransom note. You make it sound as if the BATF showed up to save those children in the first place. I have some interesting news for youBATF has absolutely NO jurisdiction in child abuse cases. It seems to me that the BATF showed up, took the Davidians hostage.

The American polls are Harris polls, and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again.

Gosh, Tim, you must have seen a different live broadcast than I did. While the smoke did emerge from one place initially, it was a considerable distance from the tank, and in a very short time, fire appeared at several places a good distance apart from there. Then there's that nagging question about why, out of all those people, only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children. If it were me, with my child, [and I wasn't committing suicide,] I believe I would have made SOME attempt to at least save the child. As it was, at least one of the survivors was attempting to GO BACK INTO THE FIRE when they were physically removed. No one lifted a finger to bring out a child, apparently. How do you explain that? And the two survivors who claimed to have doused the place with lantern oil and SET the fire (no doubt on David's orders).

Anybody got 'em??? I thought the Motor Voter bill passed. In any case, my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration. All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it. (Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move.) It's easy to register now. I simply don't see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them.

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers. In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats, which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next elections are due in 1994. Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections. British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands). The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to comply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions: 1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that is)? 2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per district?). 3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or by the joint Member State governments as it is now? 4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you? 5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government body? 6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels. MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament should meet in one city only, and if yes, which? Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are automatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail your answer directly to me and I will post it for you. I hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter. -- Roland Siebelink - Lokaal B.034 Centrum voor de Studie van Nieuwe Vrije Universiteit Brussel SCOM/NMIT Media, Informatie en Telecommunicatie Pleinlaan 2 - 1050 Brussel - Belgium Tel. direkt: +32.2.641 24 15 E-mail <rcsiebel@vnet3.vub.ac.be> Tel. centrum: +32.2.641 24 12 Talk <rcsiebel@is2.vub.ac.be> Fax centrum: +32.2.641 28 61

Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the "medically an needy" (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical care).

Sorry, but this is a red herring. Are you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue Cross? Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between the two sets of forms. Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid, the two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies. (5% versus 14%-16%). If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees, post it. Otherwise, try to stick to factual assertions. > >> And as the original post implied, it is private insurers in the US >> whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative >> costs of tax-supported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere. > > Only those that remain paper-bound and refuse to standardize. Well now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system. Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents private insurance companies from "standardizing?" In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US, but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than "free enterprise" at work. By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a single-payer system is always cheaper...".

Indeed, I believe it is the Islamic religion which avoids alcohol (I apologize if I name the wrong religion) and that is certainly a physical positive in many respects. However, this proves nothing. Just because something is a "basic, pragmatic principle of day-to-day living" TODAY doesn't mean it evolved from the same.

Religious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up (after many levels of arguments) to "Because that's how it is written." or "God says..." Now I'm not faulting that but that is not a basic, pragmatic principle as you mean it in this context. It is a belief based on faith, which by definition is not necessarily backed up by logic. Faith is a given. God is a absolute truth when arguing from religion. Also, many religions would reject your thesis that their beliefs simply come from these day-to-day principles.

An article in yesterday's Atlanta Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is faulty.

They called it the "asphalt temperature trend". We have no real long term data on remote areas, such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest, or the top of Mt.

An accompanying article mentioned that a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption. It went on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be *NO* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at least the next 50 years.

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that "deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere" it is not a valid reason for not calling them.

No one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their legal weapons. The Dividians had survived a change in leadership before so even if Koresch himself would have been convicted and sent to jail, they still could have carried on. I don't think the Dividians were insane, but I don't see a reason for mass suicide (if the fire was intentional set by some of the Dividians.) We also don't know that, if the fire was intentionally set from inside, was it a generally know plan or was this something only an inner circle knew about, or was it something two or three felt they had to do with or without Koresch's knowledge/blessing, etc.? I don't know much about Masada. Were some people throwing others over? Did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms? Richard

"Barter economy" means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose, or to buy it outside the U.S. and bring it in, if it won't grow here. They will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture. They will not, however be able to legally sell their drugs for money. Both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed, to discourage their use. "This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?" > |3.

You cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment, and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today, when these drugs are illegal to possess/use, with what it would be were they_not_illegal to possess/use. Decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment_much_easier. Drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction, and as such, the drug users should be left alone, not thrown in prison along with their victimizers. Drug_dealers_are the criminals, and should be treated as such. Drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions, however. > |4.

The drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary, not coerced, and does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V. Those convicted who are drug users, as evidenced by the test, are in need of treatment for their problem. Institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is, I would argue, the best way to help them straighten out. If they refuse the test and are convicted, their sentence can be appropriately harsher, since they, unlike the addict, have no "excuse" for their crimes. > |5.

My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal behavior. If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted, why is that not a good thing? If fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals, BTW) can find victims, why is that not a good thing? If fewer drug users, such as drunks, 'potheads,' etc., commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply, why is that not a good thing? I'm certainly willing to debate my position. You have to read it carefully though. --Standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna************************************************************** *(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg. * Conservative libertarians * * \' KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu * for Pro-Balance! * *(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com********************** "I find television very educating.

To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts [indebtedness as defined in the document] and provide for the common Defence [Defence as precisely defined] and general Welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways [that limit the government.] of the United States; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through- [out the U.S.] [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly] [ then ... ] 2. To borrow Money [...] 3. To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes] 4. To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies] 5. To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.] 6. To [punish counterfeiters] 7. To establish Post Offices and post Roads 8. To [provide patents and copyrights] 9. To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; 10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.] 11. To declare War, [and etc.] 12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch] 13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one] 14. To [make the rules for the army and navy] 15.

Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated largely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially the government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these people, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV cameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. It's just another day in the life of these United States. They don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to publicly massacre citizens. Have you seen 'The Crying Game'?

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers 4.23.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 710 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ___________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 23, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 10:35 A.M. EDT MS. MYERS: At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press conference, Bill, in the East Room. And then Saturday the President will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown. He will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to Boston. He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press plane will leave from Washington. He will meet with some -- Q What kind of a plane is that he's taking? MS. MYERS: That he's taking? He'll probably take a C- 20. Q From Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: From Hagerstown. Air Force One doesn't fly out of Hagerstown, apparently. Q How will the pool travel? MS. MYERS: The pool will have to meet him ahead of time. So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport. There is currently no provision -- and I'll double-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think that's standard operating practice. Q The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Q What time does he have to be in Boston? MS. MYERS: He's going to meet there with a group of citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at around 1:30 p.m. We're still working out the final times. Q At the airport? MS. MYERS: No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel. And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21. The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m. It will be followed by Q&A. And then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston. And that's it for the weekend. Q Has the President seen the report from -- or the letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright? And what is his reaction to their call on him? MS. MYERS: Well, obviously, the letter was written to Secretary Christopher. I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday. He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views. He believes it's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy. Q What is the President's reaction? MS. MYERS: The President hasn't seen the letter. It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher. In terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't there before. And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia. Q Is he influenced by that? I mean, how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers -- MS. MYERS: Many of the specialists in that area -- I think that that is clearly part of the process. It's something -- their views will clearly be considered. I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views. I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who work closely on the issues. Q What do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before? MS. MYERS: I think the President said last week that there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being considered. Q Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along. Is that on the table? MS. MYERS: Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the President. But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies. He's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus there. Q Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today? MS. MYERS: No. I mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today. Q Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action? MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies at this point. He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with its allies on this. Q On that point, does he believe that the U.S., though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action? MS. MYERS: Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort. I think the broader point is that anything we do, any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it. Q Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia? MS. MYERS: I think that that's why we're considering additional options. I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling. The situation in Bosnia is tragic. The President is very concerned about it. He has -- I think President Clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world community. Clearly, we're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's not enough. Q In terms of what you were just talking about, it sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to protect humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word justify. It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief. But I think that's just an explanation of the resolution. I think any action that we take will be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action. Q The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past. You're declining to do that this morning. MS. MYERS: No, I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly. MS. MYERS: I don't mean to imply a change in policy. The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q One other little question. Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it. The President has not seen it. Q They met on Monday, right? Christopher met -- surely, he must have brought that up -- MS. MYERS: Again, they may have talked privately about it, but -- Q Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected, is that correct? MS. MYERS: No, I didn't say that at all. I said I won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications. Q She's advocating unilateral action and you're saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action. MS. MYERS: I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended. Q Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to that? MS. MYERS: I think that their views are obviously being considered. The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter. Q Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do? MS. MYERS: I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now. And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Department. Now, no decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a through review underway, and that their opinions are being very seriously considered. Q If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter? Did he say, good, this bolsters my position? Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't need right now? MS. MYERS: I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate. It's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal. Q So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line? MS. MYERS: I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome. Q Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q The unilateral option is on the table? MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q We've had two different -- Q Isn't that a change, Dee Dee? Q That would be a change of policy. Q Particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out. MS. MYERS: I think the President has been -- well, no. I don't -- that is not -- Q Are you talking about all options? MS. MYERS: All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that. So let me just review again what he has said. He has said that -- the President has said all options are on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground troops, which he has never suggested. He has ruled that out from the beginning. Q Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort? MS. MYERS: He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself. I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now. I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked about in broad terms. This is a very complicated situation. The options being presented and considered are very complicated. Q Air strikes on the table? MS. MYERS: Again, I think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being discussed. Q Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- MS. MYERS: No, ground troops are not being considered. Q You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy. Then you said everything is on the table. We're confused. Are unilateral actions on the table? MS. MYERS: All I can tell you is what the President has said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this. Q Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they don't go along -- MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies on this. He's continuing to have discussions. He's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that's clear. The conversation is ongoing. We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this. Q Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians -- MS. MYERS: I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to. Q The British and the French. Q Yes, the British and French. They've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military. Does the U.S. believe differently from that? MS. MYERS: The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major, as you know. I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well. And I don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that process is ongoing. Q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday. Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action? The allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything. MS. MYERS: The consultations are ongoing. That's all I can tell you at this point. Q Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference? MS. MYERS: No, that is not the intention of the press conference. Q What is the intention? MS. MYERS: It's an opportunity to take questions. He may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia. That will not happen. Q Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: It's sort of a general statement of where we are. Q After the first hundred days, you mean? MS. MYERS: It's not a long statement. I mean, this is just generally. Don't look for any major policy pronouncements. Q Do you know what the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review. But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be. It's just to take questions. Q It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on. MS. MYERS: Since the major purpose here is just to take questions, it's not completely resolved yet. Q Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, would be an AIDS czar. Will he announce that today? And what's the delay on that? MS. MYERS: I don't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon. I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week. It is coming soon. I don't anticipate that happening today. Q What's the delay? Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar? MS. MYERS: I don't know that it's a delay. I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement. Q Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? And why wasn't her appointment announced here? MS. MYERS: The qualifications -- I don't know if there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see. I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds. Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service. I think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there. We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, which is Admiral William Crowe. Q Why would he appoint her, though, if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job? MS. MYERS: I don't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her. And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate. She never went up there for a hearing. But the President believes she's a very competent person. He's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is? Zoe Baird is on the President's Foreign Intelligence -- Q You said she never went up there for a hearing? Q Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws? MS. MYERS: Right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate. I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate. Q So you don't think that is any problem? MS. MYERS: I don't think there's any problem. Q She has been appointed to this board, is that a fact? MS. MYERS: Yes. Q Does she need confirmation for this? Does she need confirmation to be a member of the -- MS. MYERS: No. It's a presidential appointment. Q Usually, announcements are made here at the White House. Was there a decision not to announce her publicly? MS. MYERS: We didn't make an announcement. People who asked were told who the members of the board were. We didn't make an official announcement. If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names. Q I'd like to know. Q Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension? MS. MYERS: Not always. But, again, I'm happy to put this out. Q Isn't that the standard practice? Q That was past practice. MS. MYERS: Again, I'm happy to put it out. We'll put out a list of the members of the board today. Q Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely? MS. MYERS: I think generally but not always. And we're happy to put that out today. Q What is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board? MS. MYERS: There is roughly a dozen members on the board. It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the President. Again, the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe. Q And did he recommend Baird? Q What's the name of the board? MS. MYERS: It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, PFIAB. Q What's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien? Is that -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke? Q Let me phrase it another way. Why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago? MS. MYERS: Because it's not. Q What's her experience in foreign intelligence? MS. MYERS: She's an experienced attorney, someone who the President believes is very competent and qualified. And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input. Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that is not the board's mission. It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters. He believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously talented and has said that throughout. Q Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? MS. MYERS: I don't think so. On December 24th, when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board. So I don't believe there's ever been any -- Q Earlier than that, during the transition. MS. MYERS: No, I don't believe so. It was announced, again, on December 24th. Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced. Q Are members paid? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so, but I'll double-check. Q On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state? I guess it's the Texas Ranger reports. MS. MYERS: Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site. Clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it. Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet holes. I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice Department is looking into it. Q Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this? MS. MYERS: I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute. I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it. But as you know, there are several levels of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work together. Q Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything? MS. MYERS: I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that. Q What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech? MS. MYERS: It's going to be fairly general. I don't think it's going to be any specific announcements. I think it's going to be sort of a -- Q Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about? MS. MYERS: We're still working on it. But I wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that. Q Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"? (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last -- Q Foreign, domestic? MS. MYERS: A little bit of both, but I think a lot of domestic. Q And overview. MS. MYERS: Yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement. Q Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. Q Is that available? MS. MYERS: Not yet, but it will be. Sure. Q Are you going to put it out here or -- MS. MYERS: We'll probably put it out here on Sunday. Q Travel next week? MS. MYERS: Unclear. Q What was the question? Q Likely? MS. MYERS: I don't -- Q Likely? Possible? MS. MYERS: Possible. Q What's possible? MS. MYERS: Travel. Q George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week. Do you have days yet for them? MS. MYERS: Not yet. Q Can you tell us which order? MS. MYERS: Campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week. Q Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg? MS. MYERS: No. Q And any report in the aftermath of the day? MS. MYERS: Any readout from the day? Q Readout. MS. MYERS: It's possible. Jeff Eller will be down there. I think he can go through what the President did during the day. We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning. Q Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David. In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice? MS. MYERS: Twice. Q Why this weekend? MS. MYERS: He went two weekends ago, as you know, on the way home from his father-in-law's funeral. I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family. And this is just an opportunity to do the same. Q There's no march there. Q It has nothing to do with the march here? MS. MYERS: No. Q Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: He'll fly straight to Boston. Q Flying straight did you say? (Laughter.) Q George took a question yesterday on Waco. The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the FBI. And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas. Do you have an answer on that? MS. MYERS: I don't. I'll check. THE PRESS: Thank you. END10:59 A.M. EDT

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: President's Press Conference 4.23.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 838 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 23, 1993 PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT The East Room 1:00 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Terry, do you have a question? Q Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, anything to stop the fighting. Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first let me say, as you know, for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action. And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three months. Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process. We have made some progress. And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution. And Leon Fuerth, who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on implementing that. That is going to make a big difference to Serbia. And we are reviewing other options. I think we should act. We should lead -- the United States should lead. We have led for the last three months. We have moved the coalition. And to be fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part. And they have troops on the ground there. But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to. And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so. I think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it. Q Can I follow up? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Q Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust? THE PRESIDENT: I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level. I think it is without precedent or peer in human history. On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree. The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing. And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together. And I think you have to stand up against it. I think it's wrong. We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region. I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making progress on that front. But what's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the region. Q Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency. The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia. What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently? How do you look at things? Are you reassessing? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I don't really believe that the situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I don't know that the administration could have made it different. On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American government. We have abandoned trickle-down economics. We've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in only a decade. The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates. There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit. That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very, very good for the country. And so we are moving in the right direction economically. I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that. Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas. There are really people still who believe that it's not needed. I just disagree with that. I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs. So I think there was an idea base -- an argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward. Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this. I just misgauged it. And I hope that I can learn something. I've just been here 90 days. And, you know, I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get political reform there. So it takes time to change things. But I basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the Congress. Q Waco -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, with regard to Waco I don't have much to add to what I've already said. I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into. I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that. I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over. But I still maintain what I said from the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh. And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves. And I'm sorry that they killed their children. Q Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people in your tax policy. He was strongly critical of your stimulus package. He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement. How are you going to handle his political criticism? Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan? And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill? THE PRESIDENT: Let me answer that question first. We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days. I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that. With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found that rather amazing. I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot. I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I would -- go back and read his book and his plan. There's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy. But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar. So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear. I'll be glad to hear them. Q To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his political criticism? He's launched a campaign against you. Do you think you can sit back and just -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me. And if he's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are. Maybe he's got some constructive ideas. I think the American people have shown that they're very impatient with people who don't want to produce results. And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get something done. I just came here to try to change things. I want to do things. And I want to do things that help people's lives. So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will change people's lives for the better, fine. But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the President. Q Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute. You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis. The United States is the last remaining superpower. Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the United States -- surely you would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations. Q But you have a mandate and -- THE PRESIDENT: They do, and that is one of the things that we have under review. I haven't ruled out any option for action. I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there. We are not. So we are reviewing other options. But I also would remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there. They have been justifiably worried about those. But they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions. They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia. And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been. I don't have any criticism of the British, the French and others about that. Q Would that be military action? Q Mr. President, several of the leading lights in your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in your administration. Why is that? Are you losing your political grip? THE PRESIDENT: Give me an example. Q Example? Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco. Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia. All of these are things you said that you didn't support. THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I don't know what -- we know that David Koresh had sex with children. I think that is undisputed, is it not? Is it not? Does anybody dispute that? Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse. And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves. I think that qualifies as abuse. And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I don't know exactly what he said. In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes. There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next. And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next. And I'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going to do. So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school. Q How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: What was that? Q The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea. THE PRESIDENT: I don't mind them saying they think it's a good idea. There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds. That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate. No decision has been made on that. And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that. We've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy. I took no -- that wasn't taking a line against an administration policy. Q Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations. Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know about that. And I don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are. But I'll tell you this: I believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination. I believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it. I believe we need the services of all of our people, and I have said that consistently. And not as a political proposition. The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston. I was just asked the question about it. And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America. When I was Governor, I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that. Q Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it. It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press. I've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through. And that's what I do. It doesn't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, and that's what I'll continue to do. Q Mr. President, getting back to the situation in Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable. But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines. Without telling us your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision? THE PRESIDENT: I'm reluctant to get into this. There are -- those are two of the options. There are some other options that have been considered. All have pluses and minuses; all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy. I do believe that on the air strike issue, the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action, apply there. If you take action, if the United States takes action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met. We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear. The United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war. With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace? Will it lead to more bloodshed? What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy? But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration, along with some other options we have. Q Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam? And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange. How can we afford to go to any more of these wars? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there. But we are, after all, the world's only super power. We do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist. Q Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday? And in general, how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia? THE PRESIDENT: No, I have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that. We never even discussed that, interestingly enough. The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the rest of the free world very much appreciated. Q Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation? And how would you handle that situation differently now? THE PRESIDENT: I don't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail. One of the things that I'm sure will come out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten? And I look forward to that. But at the time, I have to say, as I did before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them. And then on the day before the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were sufficient. I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have asked. Q Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director Sessions' role in the Waco affair? And have you made a decision on his future? And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with him. And I mean no negative or positive inference. I have no assessment there. I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI. And I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the FBI. Q Mr. President, since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot take a partisan view in this war? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against. That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful. I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing. And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with. This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face, and that all of our allies face. And if it were easy, I suppose it would have been solved before. We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done. It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and we are now looking at what else we can do. Q Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets. Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider? THE PRESIDENT: There may be. I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different. We were then at war with Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing. But we have -- as I say, we've got all of our options under review. Q The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse. What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation? THE PRESIDENT: Well, you may know something I don't. That's not what our people tell me. I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job. The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there. It's obvious what their concerns are. They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to power. We're working toward that. I get a report on that -- we discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're going to prevail there and be successful. I do believe that there's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society. But I believe we're going to prevail there. Q Mr. President, would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of all, we passed the budget resolution in record time. That was the biggest issue. That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up. We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. We have lower interest rates across the board. We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt. We have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different. The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing opportunity. We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform. And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials. These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the campaign, but with turning the country around. The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country. We are working on a whole range of other things. The welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work. And, of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans. So I think it is amazing how much has been done. More will be done. We also passed the Family Leave bill. A version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet. And everything has been passed except the stimulus program. So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction. I feel good about it. Q Sir, a follow-up. Wouldn't you say, though, that one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own country, how can we do it for them? THE PRESIDENT: Let me recast the question a little bit. It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be fair we've got to recast it. We have already -- the first round of aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion. The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is plainly going to go through. The question is, can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress? And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future. I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress. Q The tailhook report came out this morning, documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the Navy. How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy? THE PRESIDENT: First, let me comment a little on that. The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services. And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way. I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined. It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve there. It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be pursued. The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I expected him to take the report and to do his duty. And I believe he will do that. Q Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute. The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence. But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms. THE PRESIDENT: I understand that. Q Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid? THE PRESIDENT: I believe -- the answer to your question is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election. If he wins the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform. You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here. Leaders from Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere. And in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for. You can understand that. But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think that's all we can ask. And the United States will -- if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with him. I think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform. I think that we should support that. Q Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- NAFTA. How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished? THE PRESIDENT: I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future. You know, our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side agreements. We're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is. The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission. Even in the United States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up. On the other hand, if we're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them. So what we're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be some enforcement. There must be consequences. And we're working out the details of that. But I still feel quite good about it. And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others. I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and gives us a bigger world in which to trade. I think that's the only way a rich country can grow richer. If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area. So this is an idea battle. You know, you've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for this, somebody else has got to be for that. A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong about the world toward which we're moving. And the answers are not self-evident. And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way. So I just have a difference of opinion. I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the details needed to be improved. Q Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners. General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic, he believes that it was incorrect. Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue? And more broadly, do you believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord? THE PRESIDENT: First let me say, I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he returned. And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way. As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim. I do not know whether that is right or wrong. We are having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the evaluation, we'll tell you. And, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs. I think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know. There are still some cases that we don't know the answer to. But I do believe we're making some progress. I was encouraged by the last trip. Q I'd like to follow up on that. Before the U.S. normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith? THE PRESIDENT: A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved, going back to the Second World War. But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases. And we're not there yet. Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this. And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment. I just am very influenced by how the families feel. Q your economic stimulus package, are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, the health care initiative and other things? Are there any plans to do that? And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole? THE PRESIDENT: No, what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 billion in deficit reduction. When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated that. I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that. I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed. Instead, every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader about. So it was a strange set of events. But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, "Mr. President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now. And we're all strung out and we're divided." And I think we need to do a reality check. As I said, what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to make it come out differently. Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration. The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now. We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer. I mean, we could have done a lot of good things with that money. And I think that is very, very sad. And it became more political than it should have. But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending. That just won't wash. Q and redo -- THE PRESIDENT: No. I mean, you know, for example --you mentioned the crime bill. I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill. I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year. And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill. Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun. And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street. That's another thing that -- I really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case. I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill. Q Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a second. That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior officers. Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers? THE PRESIDENT: You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command. There is now an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course. If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case. I don't really think -- I think all I can tell you is what I have already said. I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I want appropriate action to be taken. Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con. So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way. Q Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia? You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces. Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir? THE PRESIDENT: I said ground forces. Q You said ground forces. Could I ask you, sir, if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there? THE PRESIDENT: I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore. I've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there. Q With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend? Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities? THE PRESIDENT: No. Q Why not? THE PRESIDENT: Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't participate in other marches. I think once you become President, on balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should be done. But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now. And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that. And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will be here, but for others as well. Thank you very much. END1:48 P.M. EDT

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: Fact Sheet on Russian Statement 4.23.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 167 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu The White House Office of the Press Secretary --------------------------------------------------------------- For Immediate Release April 23, 1993 Background Information: Advancing U.S. Relations with Russia and the other New Independent States April 23, 1993 At the Vancouver summit, President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an economic and strategic partnership between the U.S. and Russia. Since then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps be taken to move this process forward. The Administration is announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based on its government's commitment to reform. Executive Review of Cold War Laws President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations to reflect the end of the Cold War. Congress has already acted to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other independent states. However, many laws and regulations remain that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations with Russia and the other new independent states. The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. security and other national interests, such provisions can be revised or removed. He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis. The President has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible. This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past. For example, because the Russians are eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik legislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia. By addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states. Review of COCOM It is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The United States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export controls to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology. Steps to Improve the Security Relationship The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the other states. Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons In Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for elimination under the START I Treaty. President Clinton has directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START I. In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the other relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate this process. Multilateral Test Ban The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, and that the two governments would consult with each other accordingly. The United States looks forward to beginning consultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the specific issues related to this negotiation. The United States expects to start this consultative process within the next two months. Detargeting The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear targeting at Vancouver. As the United States and Russia move into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary. The Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures that could enhance strategic stability, including recent proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles. Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship In response to the incident involving a collision between US and Russian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in late May. Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN Security Council. The United States looks forward to broadening such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations. The US and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move consideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from the discussion to the implementation phase. The U.S. is also working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements in the financing and management of UN operations. The purpose of these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions. Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform Finally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and political reformers throughout Russia and the other states. The Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo. And the Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of reform in Russia and the other states. * * * The Administration believes these steps can increase American security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states. -30-

From: cramer@optilink.COM (Clayton Cramer) Subject: The Government Is LYING Organization: Optilink Corporation, Petaluma, CA Lines: 23 Yesterday, the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had gunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the fire. Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies. At the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while Koresh had a class III (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the government as saying, no, they didn't have a license. Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect from a suicide. Our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence and negligence. Why should I believe the FBI's claims about anything else, when we can see that they are LYING?

Do it in private, and it won't be a problem. But the reason that the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is that they want: 1. To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work, and not have people get disgusted; 2. To be able to wear their NAMBLA T-shirt and not worry about getting fired; 3. To be able to have access to young boys, so that they start making the next generation of homosexuals.

How's that for an answer? :-) Seriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you are talking about a governmental employer or not. In this case, I believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination, direct or indirect, period. I feel this way not because it would offend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), but because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot escape. It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were "whites only" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountains for others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains certainly were not applied to "whites only." In essence, we cannot escape the coercive state. Even Randy Weavers have to pay property tax. On the other hand, private employers are not a monopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not by the government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over to that government. #> Why?

In Santa Cruz (where a number of loony anti-discrimination laws exist), a guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had every imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe, and his tatoos were very distracting. #> Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA.

I have a lot of interaction (all positive) with my tenants, so I guess that that isn't an issue. But say I were to buy a unit in another town, and have it managed by a third party. Let's say that I have a real aversion to Christians because of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker, and because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected. I don't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window of a house that I own. Should the government intervene? If I was Elie Weizel and the only rental applicant was Tom Metzger, should I be forced to rent this distant unit to him? #> The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned.

Yes, and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom & pop store, you and I can buy shares in IBM, and have influence over their decision making policies if we don't like them.

From: techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) Subject: The earth also pollutes...... Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines: 72 FURY OF MOTHER NATURE Man's contribution to environmental "pollution" are paltry compared to those of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, "all of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the industrial revolution do not begin to equal the quantities of toxic materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and Hekla in Iceland in 1947." To which could be added Mount St. Helens in Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into the stratosphere). LOS NINOS Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for thousands of miles. CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: "Cold water along the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the U.S. resulting in drought." TERMITE TERROR Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental "degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in "the Netherlands... manure from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are ravenous wraiths whose constant quest for food drives them to ravage standing forrests." The February 1983 issue of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that "an international team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the Carbon Dioxide that fuel burning does." According to a study reported in SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the "estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion." In addition, "Termites are a potentially important source of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global emmisions." The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide, methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere. Ants are another natural source of "pollution." In 1987, an atmospheric chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University, reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT magazine, the "ants release the acid when defending themselves and communicating with each other and upon dying. Since 30 percent of the world ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about the acid the ants release," an amount estimated at "600,000 metric tons annually." which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation." Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a "despoiler" of the environment. By Robert W. Lee. ------ techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) The Cellar BBS - (215) 539-3043 
From: techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon) Subject: some scientists do not believe in the green house effect Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines: 93 The following statement was released on February 27,1992 by the Science & Environmental Policy Project As independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems, we are concerned by the agenda for UNCED, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, being developed by environmental and activists groups and certain political leaders. This so called "Earth Summit" is scheduled to convene in Brazil in June 1992 and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations, including onerous taxes on energy fuels, on the population of the United States and other industrialized nations. Such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. They are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. A survey of U.S. Atmospheric scientists, conducted in the summer of 1991, confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century. A recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar activity), rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880. Futhermore, the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record. Yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models. Finally, agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food supply. We are disturbed that activists, anxious to stop energy and economic growth, are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying science. We fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy, on jobs, standards of living, and health care, with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the poor.

I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may be discussed intelligently! I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic minority. However, your argument again falls flat on its face. You state that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate with others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will. How do you know that you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. Had they expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

But aren't you imposing your moral standards against gay people because you do not want to rent to, or hire, or as you put associate with, ( and I do not know of a law that requires you to associate with gay people)? It works both ways. All people want to have an equal opportunity for all things that lie in the public domain. It will be a gigantic step forward when people take other people based upon ability and talent, rather than skin color, eye color, height, weight, sexual orientation (and I use this last one as meaning gay, bi, straight, let's not go off on the tangent about pedophiles, rapist, etc.)

Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested ?twice? by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant and went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under arrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told that they suspected him of molesting children and having several wives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed their story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed. And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing him just a week before the raid. How would I have handled it differently? Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything wrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which keep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING. OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for. Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send officers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests. Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason to suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't anyone TRY serving a warrant? OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to raid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak, and they know your coming. SO what do you do? Well, change your plans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including sending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I don't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid should NEVER have happened. The shit that came later should NEVER have happened. The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us know what the hell really happened there. The lies should NEVER have been told. <MC> -- || Mark Craig Carroll: <MC> ||"We the people are getting tired of your lies || Univ of Delaware, Dept of CIS|| We the people now believe that it's time || Grad Student/Labstaff Hacker || We're demanding our rights to the answers || carroll@udel.edu || We elect a precedent to state of mind"-Fish

Wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here. There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant. The BATF had a no-knock warrant.

(BATF admits this!) >If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing >the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could >hear it. Let's be realistic here, shall we? You're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. Someone comes to your building, dressed in black suits, carrying firearms. They throw a concussion grenade at the place, and try to break in. What, exactly, are you going to do? I would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying themselves. If someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing explosive, I think I'd be entirely justified in defending myself. Regardless of what I think of the BDs, and regardless of whether or not they were guilty of firearms violations, this is NOT the way you treat people in a supposedly free society. <MC> -- || Mark Craig Carroll: <MC> ||"We the people are getting tired of your lies || Univ of Delaware, Dept of CIS|| We the people now believe that it's time || Grad Student/Labstaff Hacker || We're demanding our rights to the answers || carroll@udel.edu || We elect a precedent to state of mind"-Fish

The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one. And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from $4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over Oregon's). It would seem to me that this increase does not keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be to $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise the minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give a 10% cost of living increase every 4 July. and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people. chus pyotr -- pyotr@halcyon.com Sometimes Pyotr Filipivich, sometimes Owl.

The second fire starts in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high. The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire starting. Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate locations. The FBI report a third. I was not able to verify it from the videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind the small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle. The flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange. This is the normal colour for carbon compounds burning. The flames were those of a solid or confined liquid burning, not of a gas exploding. The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an explosive though. The cloud itself is on fire.

Depends entirely on how they were distributed. You would not be able to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage from a mile away.

If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs.

What's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all sorts of people desperately trying to "get a revolution." It makes "ambulance chasing" by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime. For the last few months, benighted souls have been calling C-SPAN on issues as mundane as budget resolutions, saying that "I don't know, I just have the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country," and so on. Get real! For a real case study in revolution, go to Blockbuster Video and check out "Underground," a film made about the Weather Underground in the 70's. Even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never did come. And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times? In the tape, it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a Greenwich village townhouse. The problem, one of them said, was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about their own personal safety and weren't "careful." But of course that was *society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in the people, so they neglect their own safety. Current apologists for Koresh may pick up some important rationalization tips from this tape! --- Joe Knapp jmk@cbvox.att.com

THINK, man. The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might have illegal automatic weapons. If they expected, as you state, that `the B-D to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one, maybe two agents up to the front door, knock, and attempt to serve the warrant on the person answering the door. Scenario one, that person lets them in to perform the search and no one gets hurt. Scenario two, the person answering the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers. Now you have two dead BATF agents instead of four, the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible without harm to the innocent people/children within the compound. > >The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by >ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

And if the bloody warrants were "legal" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started? And if Koresh had declared himself a "private state" and was just daring the gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant, which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car? That doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows he has a court battle.

This is stupid. That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_ the FBI using any until yesterday. When they use maximum force they do just what they did that first day that got four officers killed. >The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by >ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

Phil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you will back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like.

This isn't a Libertarian issue, others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right. _Anything_ that leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.

That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than 10 percent. 2. That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone. 3. Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many preventable diseases. 4. We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs. (To put that in perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.) 5. The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on health benefits. Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere else. How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world? The only thing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it. And the "private" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society - individuals, government, and industry. Of the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion was thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and procedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world. There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA. But did the "private competition" stimulate more efficient paperwork? Ask any doctor who's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all! The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down. The competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment. Spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle isn't my idea of the world's best health care system. Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful. I'm especially thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and Cesarean section. Sound like the world's best health care system? Ever notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system? First of all, Hillary Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system. I think that's been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months. Where did John F. McManus get that idea, anyway? Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border. Your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals. The nearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an American city one hour south. Which way are you going to go? Is it because the American system is the "best" in the world, or just for convenience? It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform. There are a million different ways we ould restructure the system. It's not just a choice between total government control and total private control. I wish the people screaming "socialized medicine" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM THEMSELVES on health care issues. The current system sucks. I want to keep providers private but that doesn't change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. Purely private health care without any government intervention doesn't work. Hillary Clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers. How can you scream "socialized medicine" at her programs? Don't you even know what you're talking about? Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade? Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing? Why? I'll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don't do something about it. PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. The current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well-being. Costs are still rising 10 percent a year even as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into managed-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask me. A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please come forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set about keeping costs down. I didn't get a single answer. The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like "give health care back to the people." Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms? What is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help? How can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults? How can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our infrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems? America needs health care reform NOW. Don't just sit there and Hillary-bash, inform yourself! Jim Reynolds -- James P. Reynolds (that's Jim to you and me.) jpr1@lehigh.edu

Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues. I am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are. I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies. They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that you're trying to exterminate. The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid. It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his property. He could have been served with a search warrant then. He could have been arrested if he had refused to comply. Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property. This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides. Those were the first two mistakes: the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served. At this point, the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis. That's when the government started covering their traces, sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of the incident, etc. Things were already building up to disaster. Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited. But according to Janet Reno, that option had "never been seriously considered". So, supposedly because the agents were "frustrated and fatigued", and because there supposedly were no backups, they felt they had to go in. Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the fire. If that's so, he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound. But the government's hands are far from clean. Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the 4th amendment. The motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable. And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter. We have only some very biased FBI agents' word for what happened. And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion. Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents.

There is something terribly wrong, however, with a culture which condemns, attacks, and all too often kills any of its members who attempt to get an education.

Mr. Cramer, when are you going to stop indulging in such blatant lies? This is not only not true, you know damned well that it's not true. None of your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this position. This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any research or any knowledge.

The number of homosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%. Source: a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry, the title escapes me).

Oh, you definitely have a choice. You realize, of course, that you are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade. How are you planning on celebrating two years of lies? Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans, women, and other minorities who also want to "impose their morality on others". After all, they also want the government to "tell peaceful people how to live." Therefore, you really "have no choice", but to continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not a lifestyle, but a sickness. It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer. It was bullshit when you began this crusade and it's still bullshit. I am continually amazed at the depths to which you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.

Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that has a range of 3000 meters. Next question. The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead he ordered the murder of the children. In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes they were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons. The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than 80. Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon. Can you think of a better way of getting the children out? A 100% certain way? The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require them to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through. This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters. Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF agents and 17 children on his or her conscience. There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO may not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage. The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation. this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

Do not have daily press conferences, do your best to keep things out of the press. As things get more and more miserable inside, one of two things is going to happen: 1.

The thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and "assults" play into the hands of a "leader" who has picked this course. Its much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there is gas coming in and bullets in the air. Let them be hungry and miserable for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective. The "possiblity" that they would all kill themselves at some point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics. If people are going to take their own lives, the best you can probably do is prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to do it.

You answered the question yourself ... "private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow", and I think that it's about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are.

Remember that our "system" is only an insurance policy. But our costs aren't rising fast enough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year, Quebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of "$5" as the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather than give the QMA a raise. And it's not contract time yet, as far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ... Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian" faction, holds our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these). But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public spending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, with little haste if elected. >I know that, for Pete's sake, I live right on the border.

Yeah, but there'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that would preclude it. If provincial governments (as bad as some of them are; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the Conservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible, there is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that it's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink. Right now, attempts to get the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like cod-liver oil ... >>>Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no >>>obligation to.

Most Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ... (-; Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy prof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ... and in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes with that population or larger. Anyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those in the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden transients in spending are unlikely. In fact, the health allocation is one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border. >If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back, the >things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like >luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable. This won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada to have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad thing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and frustrate the socialists chanting "Hey, it's *free*!"). gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

THANK you for playing, but obviously you are not reading the material as it is presented. According to the report I've got in my hands, the Newsweek article (which reported that "2 to 3 percent" of the population is gay) used the criteria of "No heterosexual contact in the past year." But at the same time, the University of Denver study points out, quite dramatically, that 60% of all self-identifying gay men have > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year. I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual contact of any kind in the previous year, they are counted as heterosexual.

So, you approve of the BATF launching a 100-person raid, complete with flack jackets, men hidden in horse trailers, stun grenades, semi-auto weapons on peaceful citizens? who would also accept a search authoried by a court? There is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal weapons. Nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF, unless they were thought to have a still, or be smoking untaxed cigarettes. The automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter ! You don't serve no-knock warrants on someone with .50 CAL MGs.

And with gay men, where both partners can prove status through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation where there is a lot of sex.

In such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the hostage.

I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand. The media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data. One good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are posting. There is little evidence to show that they are in error. The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex events, however. I'm sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted. Cases that come to mind are the invasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco, the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military, the war on drugs, and many others. The story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey. While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey. I do, however, think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's analysis of this data. In this particular case, there was little analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her own convictions. Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the American media are merely a number of businesses, who's purpose in life is to make money for their owners and stockholders. Revenues come largely from advertisers who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar. The media is like fast food; the quality of the food (or of the reporting) will improve only if the customers demand as such. Otherwise, it is business as usual. -- Mark Walsh (walsh@optilink) -- UUCP: uunet!optilink!walsh Amateur Radio: KM6XU@WX3K -- AOL: BigCookie@aol.com -- USCF: L10861 "What, me worry?" - William M.

So we've got a situation where we have several options: 1) The crime rate decreased: Obviously gun control worked. 2) The crime rate remained the same: It would have been worse without gun control. 3) The crime rate increased: Perhaps the laws prevented an even bigger increase. Cute testing ground we've got. All responses support the proposition that gun control works. The question is this: Did Washington D.C. experiance an increase in its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws. If it did, then the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to "control" did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Good point again. Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared to the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal organization to coordinate it. If anything, bureaucracy now needs to be built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing them in blocks.

Why have >you omitted that level from your model? Yes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the principles of Fractal Federalism. All government powers derive from the People; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes that power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures. We can of course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our Constitutional Convention :-). Once a power has been granted, it may be exercised by the legislature. Powers not in the original Constitutions must percolate upward, starting from the individual. The ratification process for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority. Granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government structure). This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read- "liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on). It is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- "big-government conservatives"). I personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and economic) that is going on now. This is IMHO a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in. >> 2) A free market works on government, not just economics. Succesful >> ideas propogate, unsuccessful ideas die. >What is your definition of a "successful" idea or a "successful" >government? One which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its people, while working within the realities of human nature. You do bring up the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means necessarily a "successful" idea. I believe that Fractal Federalism would at least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity to democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas. If the Docialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis. If Libertopia is possible, it will arise. If a balanced Conservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best. >> As far as "set the moral tone" is concerned, if a community does not >> collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of >> their kids, why should they have to?

Right, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower the government") except through the amendment process. That is how the Federal Government is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the Supreme Court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense. In my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever level we are talking about) could indeed ban churches. The constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion. The uppermost Constitution is still the Supreme Law of the Land. >(I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free-market >competition among various ideas, and yet support the right of he >majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don't like.) It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas. One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and they also need to have some control over their environment. In my "Fractal Federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the constitutions. Other "rights" are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them. When a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed upon. This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom, but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes are a good idea. I am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to control the environment that their children live in. People feel that they have a "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances. There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods. I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual instances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in. I see the alternative as near anarchy. Like I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity. There are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group. I think that the "Fractal Federalism" approach is a sound, if not ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power. The libertarian scenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have right now is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the Supreme Court." >> The problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the >> fundamental dilemma of democratic government: The People have a right >> to exercise a voice in their community, yet individuals have the right >> to be left to themselves.

I am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas (I call them "my ideas", but they all come from an "average guy" reading of the U.S. Constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia). >But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as >bad.

Admittedly, it's the >lesser of two evils, and it's not less by very much, and they're both >pretty damn evil... Sorry, the confusion was my fault. When I said that "Fractal Federalism" resembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear. I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every individual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement). It is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the situation we have now. That is why I think the Supreme Court should be a jury court, with a different jury for each case. It is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still find it a repugnant idea? If so, what is your solution? >> Ideally, everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government >> coercive power of any kind would be necessary.

Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church leader who is now a consultant on cults. He said the FBI's approach was totally wrong. He said they should have tried to break down the BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means. Koresh's whole theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this. The Feds played into his hands **PERFECTLY**. By surrounding the compound with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was evil and threatening. He said instead they should have set up a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly. If they broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members' childhoods. The idea is to make the outside world and surrender seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative. Interesting comments. ---peter

As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek. Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first. Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.

The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people, says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces.

Non-toxic tear gas?!? Do you know what tear gas is? I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:). The sensation was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart. I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor). I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children. For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully understanding the cause. Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed to a tiny dose of tear gas. (It was in Athens, on the street leading to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the next day.) Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc., the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and wondered what disease or other health problem I had. (I didn't find out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.) I can imagine how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children: suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of control of your body---and not knowing the cause. ``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.'' Yeah, right. -- -30- Bob Ingria

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle it. It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous. Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective. The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be? If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff. The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted to arrest their former ally. |>And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun |>discussion.

You know, you have a point here, but don't stop with African Americans... When I was in high school in the early 1980s, on various occasions I had knives pulled on me, had friends who were stabbed, and I was beaten up repeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different. And don't let the teachers off the hook either. On many many occasions, there were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they would just watch quietly... All of this was in a nice white middle class high school. In fact, we were so nice and white that we made sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom with his white girlfriend... This isn't a race thing, it's the way public schools seem to be run... I'd hate to be in high school right now...

Right? James Madison, Federalist Paper 41: "It has been urged and echoed, that the power ``to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare...

But what color can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon? ...

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap. Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters section of the US version of CND by any chance? There are cases where society has to be protected from madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide. The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero. I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse. Phill Hallam-Baker

HHS Secretary Shalala to Address AFT's Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Conference To: National and Assignment desks, Education Writer Contact: Jamie Horwitz of American Federation of Teachers, 202-879-4447 News Advisory: Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala will speak to the 16th annual AFT Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Conference at 8 p.m., Friday, April 23, at the Washington Hilton. Shalala will discuss HHS's agenda for helping children over the next four years. AFT's Paraprofessional and School-Related Personnel Division includes school workers such as paraprofessionals and teacher aides, school bus drivers, school secretaries, school custodians and maintenance workers and school food service workers. More than a thousand school employees will attend the conference which is being held at the Washington Hilton, April 23-25. Most of the school workers attending the conference come from urban school districts where child health and nutrition, welfare reform and the availability of Head Start and other preschool programs are major issues.

Let me tell you a story then... One evening not long in this country a man, a parolee, a convicted KNOWN violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law. He decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest. When police use metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law, how this was a perfect example of police oppression, how all the police had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei, how nothing the victim did could have possibly warranted the response - some blows with a few sticks - he got from the authorities. Funny, how when it's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots, a group of people who were bothering no one, were not know to have broken any law, who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion as they fit, how it is now that the government is justified in assualting those people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun grabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they should have. Now when it's the Clinton administration that has the blood of dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it's the people who refused to have their civil rights violated, it's their fault, those evil fanatics provoked it... How is it in the mind of the liberal Democrat-Clinton supporter that a crimminal puke, scum bag, piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have possibly provoked the beating he got, but this bunch of wierdos could cause a fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them and their children, all by themselves with no help from the the police. And to here people say they deserved what they got, to hear Clinton say the blame rest solely with Koresch, what a cowardly piece of work that man has shown, again, himself to be. WE'RE blaming the right people. It is you and others that defend ANY of the actions of the BATF, FBI or Justice Department in this matter, that with each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy, the double standard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to. While at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only excuses to offer their victims. It's all to clear these days, from the comments of the "president" and the rationalizations of his supporters in these groups, that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced, and this administration intends to enforce laws, apply the Constitution and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so.

There is a vast difference >between Equal Justice under the Law and Egalitarianism. What I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of "natural rights" and how the government (and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that philosophy. This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People. This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the Court Rules the Country. The people on the Court may well be trying to do the best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever. Eventually, an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear. Try Supreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great deal. Those who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any level (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto standard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, virtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), government power. > And *why* should your community be allowed to stop my activities >when I'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you? Just because >you don't like it? Because you find it morally repugnant? This is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities. Very few human activities indeed fit into this category. Even for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity? Who defines "picking my pocket" and "defrauding"? Are economic assets a person's only assets, or are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional environment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person's assets? What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to? What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability? If you say that what you do does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that? Who is empowered to make these value judgements? >How >would *you* feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity >(or insert your favorite cause here) morally repugnant and >passed laws to outlaw its free exercise?

If it did not, and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local Constitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government to do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values.

The debate is not whether you or a >communitity would or would not vote away my rights; it is >the propriety of whether that should even be an *option*. When you define "rights" very broadly, there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these "rights" overlap. Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights. The fundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created. If you support the current situation with a "natural rights" Supreme Court (rather than an "original understanding" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme Court by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, D.C. create those powers out of the air. In my "Fractal Federalism" scenario, it is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that creates those powers. >> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood >> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

The Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power, power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish. The constitutionality of "no-knock" warrants seems very dubious to me, not to mention the mere existence of BATF and the government's propensity to ignore the word "infringe" in the Second Amendment. This power is upheld by the same body, with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people, that has upheld much so-called "Civil Rights" (read- affirmative action) legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment. > >> > Who said anything about the public till?

Seems to me when you isolate someone, try to send them crazy by playing loudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants, etc., you don`t have much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy. (I`m not too sure of their sanity to start with.) I am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication, and sends the press 2 miles away. I have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not stand up to scrutiny. I don`t think no-knock warrants are what the constitution writers had in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure. I don`t think an all-powerful central, high-taxing government was what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights to the citizens and states and restricted central government.

No, it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it. There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions (and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option). I guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance, but so far I've not come across that up north ... and I take pains to keep tabs with news from home. >And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an >effective cartel-they don't really need to compete because, as you put >it, they're in a "win-win" situation and they're guaranteed to turn a >profit Believe me, they probably had orgasms when they figured that out.

I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ... no, scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada, and *quite* a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle (out with the nationalism, in with the French capitalism). La Groupe des Cooper- antes built a new tower by the Eaton('s) store at Les Terraces, and if you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS's Crimetime you'd see it as the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top. As for Ontario, which still dominates and anchors business up north ... Canada is a very old-money kind of place, and the 1989 Free Trade Agreement saw a lot of odd alliances: labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side, and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other. The final Trudeau administration and the first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money, and that motivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's initiative (Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count of his caucus after the 1984 election). >It's not really insurance if you don't have alternatives Well, you have to realize that in our society that's like saying that "it's not really national defence" because you can't hire your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist. (BTW, there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes, but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives ... and we're talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government, regardless of party; one of their few redeeming characteristics, it seems (-;). >Also, in the April 14 Globe and Mail, there was a letter from the >director of trauma services at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto >responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in >California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that >American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada >rationed vital services. The doctor (I can't recall his name) said >that Canada *is* rationing vital services "as any physician can >plainly see". He said that a system in which people are refused >treatment because they can't afford it is no different from a system >in which people are refused treatment because the government can't >afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health >insurance plan. In fairness, he did say that both the US and >Canadian systems are in the same situation. The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of high demand, which is more a function of the doctors monopoly's tight fist on the licencing. An obvious difference is that in such a transient period, the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we've seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient* situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the California health infrastructure, the same would result --- rationing among the insured population. With smaller markets, there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than California (which by the way, has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a MUCH more dense area). So he is correct in that the resources are fixed (for a particular time window, or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either case. As for being "refused treatment" the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen; Canadians can be geographically bad, too, not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance isn't ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine. >I know, I know, the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads >them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more >money from the government (another case of businessmen, once >scratched, becoming socialists). Right, as I've pointed out above ... >But hasn't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place >to the other? It hasn't really solved it. Either way, the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of disasters (e.g., Chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart disease). A doctor needs 4-6 years of training, plus internship and specialty training. >People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their >insurance when they really don't need to. That's why I've argued for deductible and copayments rather than education, which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for (the leftists?

Also, note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold ... in most, it's your private insurance that covers it just like in the U.S. Still, it all adds up in the OECD measures. >In fact, Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people >get Don Cherry jokes (:-).

The medical IRA would have limited use, as you'd need a lower catastrophic threshold else there'd still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their IRA. Also, Singapore has a much more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses (if Singaporeans that I've met are any indication ...

It's about time! I've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don't invest in their own private practices ... in the end, it's their money. But they choose to spend it on America's Cup pipedreams, and that's none of my business. As for "provincially owned" ... for sure it's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser- vations. What that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding. Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north. My own best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first. >There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of >two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act. No, it's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices ... and always have. They can all take cash anyways ... so why not have a particular facility? The Canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist ... Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values, then Canadians can do the same. As I've pointed out above, the law states that it is illegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for the military and natives. Look, nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ... nobody stopped them when they bought it. Nobody seems to be stopping them from using it, either. Much ado about nothing.

I'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere, because the GAO study of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a problem.

Let's try that again: Why was the BATF concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door?

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party, regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price which is set by the state.

It did something that we as > a capitalistic society should want them to do: build a factory, create > industry and jobs. The cost of compliance was grossly > disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs. Bang. Here's one of the places where we widely diverge. You believe that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute. _Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party, Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party, the Atlantic Cement Company. The facts supported Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so. End of story. There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs. Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court. > Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because > of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1, > you'd be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I'd probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency. In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment. What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air? * * * * * >>> Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant. >>> If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation, >>> you'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with >>> property rights, and Fifth Amendment violations.

Yes. So what? The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society. If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights, fine. Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant. (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-) > That's the whole point behind the Coase Theorem.

Which "one" are you speaking of? _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights. Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors. In the real world (1) some people are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational" from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so. I don't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head, so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price. * * * * * >> And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were >> avoided."

Why should we treat a nuisance > plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff? We don't > require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation; > why in tort? Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment. As to your "Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made whole, because the award of damages in involuntary" claim, you're at least partially right. Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer). In these cases, the "sale" has already taken place and is irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood. Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented from happening at all) by order of the court. In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price. There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding. It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves. >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the >> business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided? >> (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive. In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business. The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant. There's nothing punitive or unjust about it. >> (2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to >> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. >> [wdstarr] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person?

Fante} \endauthor \date {April 20, 1993} \enddate \endtopmatter In a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to pull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.'' The 51 day standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19 in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire. Now that the multi-million dollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and assigning blame. \ From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President Clinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney general or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was {\it entirely theirs}. {\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter Attorney General Janet Reno. After most of the Branch Davidians died, Reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision. ``I approved the plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the details.'' In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.'' As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said that he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that ``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today.'' Later he went on to say ``I stand by that [Reno's] decision.'' \ How did this all begin? At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile assault on the Branch Davidian's compound. This raid was much more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons. The assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF to show their might and just purpose. \ At the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began. Silently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started their ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings. \ If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues were to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself? The tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle. \ The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful. Unfortunately, lives were lost on both sides. But, had the assault been a success, the liberal media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents carting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts. Of course, any violation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media would proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the BATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the Branch Davidians. \ As far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like Philadelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless, and a city block razed. It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock raids to execute search warrants. Don't let the BATF convince you that the no-knock raid was justified. No-knock assaults make sense when looking for, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds. The BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds. What ever happened to ``This is the police! You are surrounded...''? {\it This policy of no-knock raids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}. Further, the use of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea, and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that their fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures''] are not denied. \ \ \ \noindent Matthew L.

The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer, a value called the median- which one used this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners. Homosexuals are purported to make up only 1%. In this case, the majority of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual. It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.

Apologies to those who've seen the following before:] To explain my position on the "War On Drugs," I offer this: Drugs And Crime: A New Approach by Ken Barnes Given that: 1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation. 2. People who want drugs (particularly people who are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get them, whether or not they are legally available. 3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs are readily available to those who want them. 4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country, and this occurs in a variety of ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are unable to learn, to the spread of disease among addicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking. 5. A general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of, and whatever is taxed you get less of. To be most effective in confronting the nation's drug problem, some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive. While this country's current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking, and designated-driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be said for the "war" on illegal drugs. There remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers, pushers, growers, processors, kingpins, and gangsters. These networks and their "marketing activities," which include drive- by shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities, and smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day. Clearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are linked. It takes only a moment's reflection to recognize how they are linked. The link is money. As with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption, a black market has been created, in which greedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a bygone era, have profited enormously from their illegal trade. The victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug users themselves. Were it not for the black market, and the violent monopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be the thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand. In the absence of the drug lords, most would be, I believe, simply people with a problem, either a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a criminal problem. Let me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of Prohibition off the hook. On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine, or any other presently illegal drug for that matter. Neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users, until "the land of the free and the home of the brave" looks like a police state. Here then is my proposal: 1. Possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them remains illegal. 'Potheads' can grow their own marijuana (as many already do today), other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops. 2. Because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users, the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle. If these drugs can be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy them? Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek to sell these "noncommercial" drugs even at relatively low prices. Therefore, 3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell, and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices. But here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their victims. 4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test. Those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be institutionalized until they are clean, and only then will they begin to serve their sentence. If they choose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they can begin to serve their sentence right away. Those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences. 5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes: Drug using criminals (and this includes drunk and/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their sources of supply, thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large, and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business. Institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out, before becoming part of the general prison population. While helping protect society from crime, institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals, since drug using criminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up. Institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease, with the potential to benefit both themselves and others. 6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves, and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations. Under this proposal, dealers would be more readily identifiable, since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test, or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them. Declining to take the test, they would of course face stiffer penalties. While each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of a suspect's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution. 7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns, noncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money generated should be used to combat their use. Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however, and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users, since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing Prohibition. Instead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations, they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed. If drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid, they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax. The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession. Revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising campaigns, and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment. 8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended. Federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated. While my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm drugs have on our society, particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade. So long as we remain a free nation, with relatively porous borders, and freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always have a drug problem. Whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking, the results are the same: needless suffering and death. As a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs, as we are already doing (regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others. We must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users. By taking the profits out of their deadly trade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations. The question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you're talking about. Different drugs have different effects, and some are more addictive than others. The addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals, and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot resist the bottle. Nicotine, which former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as heroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects, and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone, others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer. For those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own, we may argue that because they have chosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on their part, or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life. But for the addicts, while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the time they discover their addiction it is too late. We cannot hold them responsible for their disease, any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim. Perhaps they should have known not to go near the water, or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger, but in their present circumstances warnings will not help. Neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights. --Standard disclaimer-- *.x,*dna************************************************************** *(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg. * Conservative libertarians * * \' KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu * for Pro-Balance! * *(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com********************** "I find television very educating.

I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million queers in the march on Washington. The largest figure I've seen in the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with their numbers. :) For another thing, 1% of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6. Maybe that's where you got the 2.5 million number. Also, the number cited in the actual report is 1.5% so that would be about 3.75 million. As for this march on Washington, I wonder how much the media is going to inflate the numbers this time. Last time, for the pro-abortion rally, they more than doubled the actual number of people who showed up. That and all the stories coming out of how the press "slants" the news really makes one wonder who's watching the watchers.

Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system as well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost won. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in return for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than 30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it was twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for rent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that. Some 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30% unemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies, no entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've saved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your kids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also buy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter.

If you want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a good job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something else. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with anybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils.

They are the ones that converted your 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones who always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse.

I can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and their heirs. That would be worth it.

Pomeroy, Bell, Weinberg, 1967. "National Institute of Mental Health Paper 12353, ''Patterns of Adjusment in Deviant Populations.''" Cited as part of the National Institute of Mental Health Task Force on Homosexuality. Pomery concluded, "The Kinsey statistic of 37% is probably higher than is realistic. According to these estimates, 33% is a more realistic figure." (I went out and bought LOTS of Bell & Weinberg this weekend... can you tell?) Also, The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior (Samuel S. Janus, Ph.D. and Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has the following: Table 3.14 Have you ever had a homosexual experience? Men. Women.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery, Gebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the finding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with an further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and 5% self-identifying themselves as "bisexuals." (pp 69, 70) As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read: Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert? by Philip Nobile Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a secret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids. But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin~ cultural influence. His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the sheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals. His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000 men and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations, homosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as strawberry shortcake. Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination. Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at the Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey revisionists as well as his Inspector Javert. In 1983, during a radio interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of having been inolved in "the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children." She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests. Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a different book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette, Louisiana. Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission ("the coital alignment technique") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes. In the book Eichel contends that "Kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality." If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports are, as the introduction boldly asserts, "the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century." And if they are wrong, Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear. Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's detractors, legends are not what they used to be. Martin Luther King may have committed plagiarism. Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental patients around. Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House, preyed on runaway boys. Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another. So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange people having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet. The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job. As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie. The 55-year-old former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional standing, no current university position, and no peer-review publications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom accomplishments. For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back the Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited by others. Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University. Although Reisman has no bachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctorate in 1979. Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian TV commentator. But on the resume, Reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: "The Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media Effects." When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it was love at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's Justice Department. Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the United States. After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent of Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests. First he tried to shovel her $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs. Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but $734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe of child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust ler. (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general's pornography commission.) When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986, it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department. That spring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house. Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right. As the darling of the sex cranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men's magazines and blames AIDS on gays. Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is Reisman's latest grasp for respectability. Pat Buchanan, of course, is putting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication. "This book is social dynamite," he says in a blurb an the front cover. He especially liked the antigay parts. Smacking his lips in his syndicated column, he declared, "It may just blow the sewer cap off Kinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50 aberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's 'research.'" The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who molested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983. Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children were the basis for Kinsey's conclusions... on childhood sexuality. Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost 15 years. This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in promoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity. In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how part of Kinsey's child sexuality research took place. Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual on child molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as Reisman said: [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A. camp counselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his marriage." As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview. "If you've ever been around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive," he averred. "Everything in his life is directed at getting children. I didn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's high school picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no, [sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?" Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of Kinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientific modus operandi. He was a fiendish collector. As a young zoologist with a D.Sc. from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5 million related insects. When he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he was no less curious or acquisitive. Nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him. He compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism. Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros, fascinated him. It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins. And so with the fervor of his bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though even his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex. Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: "Some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal." Although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the documentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold. There was nothing like it in the literature. Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met. This man, whose history took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and grandmother. A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys. Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involved following some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well as the speed and the capacity of climax. What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey had reported as fact. Children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle. "These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy," he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948. Then along came Judith Reisman. Ignorng the legitimacy of Kinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington. She was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker. And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal. Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text. There is no evidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a trace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments. After 12 years on the trail, Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge- - amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey's coauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken. It turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research. After frisking every "the" and "and" in both books, Reisman came up with what she believes are "smoking" sentences. To establish Kinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that "there is a hint" in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey "directed" the orgasm studies on kids. She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that "writers...test their theories...by empirical study and statistical procedures." Then she combines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources "were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved." Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthy experimentation-- she arrives at her hint. But realizing this dog would not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement. As for the alleged participation, after poring over Pomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting Kinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex. Here the chain of reasoning is more complex. She points out that Kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic. Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the purpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming "animal sex"-- Reisman asserts that a "similar misrepresentation may yet apply to Kinsey's child sex experiments." Catch the "may"! Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: "Kinsey, according to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things for himself. Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit. Because he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist. How then did Kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' of a sex offender?" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their records.) From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides, sperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed the legendary Kinsey. Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey Institute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington. Reached by telephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied Reisman's nasty imputations. "I don't understand the resistance of people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children," Gebhard said more in exasperation than anger. "That is where sex begins. We were happy to take data wherever we found it. Even though pedophiles commit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks. They wouldn't be very successful if they were. One of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students. As for directing experiments, that's absurd. We never told any of our subjects what to do. lt was against our principles. Almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway. Nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves. That would have been highly inappropriate." I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation. "I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and Kinsey watched it." As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded in confidentiality. He was married to the same woman for 35 years and fathered four children. Apparently, there are no huge sexual revelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years. Gebhard took his boss's history back in the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows. "We never divulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive," he says. Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years. In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing "the Kinsey practice of euphemizing incest." My offense was using the biblical variant "lying with a near relative" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest. As a synonym for intercourse, "lying with" appears eight times in Genesis. Ed Eichel is a different story. Though seemingly obsessed by Kinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations. He told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in the early '80s. "It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals," he says. Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm. No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections. Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman, and from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born. Eichel's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks "the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people" which, by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior, "would open the way for the second and more difficult step-- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children)." When I pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions, he said weakly, "You don't think Kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey reports." Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of Kinsey and his data. Perfect. That's just what the country needs-- a House Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer or-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.

Just maybe you won't be home. Then you can come home to something like this: "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster. "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final. But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday." That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag. When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news. "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.' I couldn't believe it. Then I walked inside. What a nightmare." It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life. Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number." The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...." Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster. They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process. Then, they left. The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked. The ammo and guns were left unsecured. "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch. Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own. A child could have taken a gun. The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around. I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them. While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off. They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note. "Nothing Found - ATF." "They didn't make any attempt to notify me. I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket. How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home? They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property. They didn't even come by to explain what happened. They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left." Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent. "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.' I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?' And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.' "'I can't come down!' I said. 'My doors are broken!' If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own. Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around." Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself." "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him. 'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.' And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'" So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, make sure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap. > It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going > to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up > with a charismatic nutcase.

As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships or just for sex) in primarily straight circles. Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose.

So the available pool for dates can be the same size. Unless of course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population. As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic, and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship. Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to be more sex. Or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up" is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males. (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners doesn't mean they're promiscuous. yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships, and be monogamous or nearly so...) -- ____ Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu) Email, 'talk' always welcome. \bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon \/ B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+

EDT THE PRESIDENT: On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued. The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life. The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane. He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency. He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February. Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. I was informed of the plan to end the siege. I discussed it with Attorney General Reno. I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask. I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive. He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future. I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently. I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review. Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people. I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco. I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks. And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. Q Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided -- Q Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT: I can't hear you both. If one will go first and then the other. Q Sorry. Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once. Q Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building. And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire. In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side. I asked a number of questions. The first question I asked is, why now? We have waited seven weeks; why now? The reasons I was given were the following: Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. They might be needed in other parts of the country. Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out. Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time. And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good. She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it. And so I asked if the military had been consulted. The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it. And I stand by that today. Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: Wait. Go ahead. Q Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm bewildered by it. The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody. It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place. I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning. A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. I will say this, however. I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves. (Applause.) I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. They were heavily armed. They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on. We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life. They made the decision to immolate themselves. And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children. But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. And she said, it's because of the children. They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time. I have to take their word for that. So that is where I think things stand. Q Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience? And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way? THE PRESIDENT: No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today. This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time. This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time. We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way. Is there something else we should have known? Is there some other question they should have asked? Is there some other question I should have asked? Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? I don't know that. That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. And we may have to confront it again. And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved. But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. Q Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday? THE PRESIDENT: Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way. There were lots of other options pursued. If you go back -- you all covered it very well. The FBI -- you did a very good job of it. I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working. Some of the children got out, some of the other people left. There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities. And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought. Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? Q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? THE PRESIDENT: That's up to the Congress. They can do whatever they want. But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts. And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate. There is nothing to hide here. This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country. Go ahead, Sarah. Q There are two questions I want to ask you. The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks. And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? THE PRESIDENT: They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them. Q What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT: Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent. And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work. So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. MS. MYERS: Last question. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying that -- Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? THE PRESIDENT: What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen. And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway. And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future. That was the judgment they made. Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning? I was sick. I felt terrible. And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know. Thank you. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision? Isn't it, in the end, your decision? THE PRESIDENT: Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI. I didn't go over every strategic part of it. It is a decision for which I take responsibility. I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call. When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed. She might have made a decision to change her mind. I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her. She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am. But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have. Thank you. (Applause.) END1:55 P.M. EDT

Typical response: lack of logic. Define 'deviant': someone who deviates from the normal. Ok, so far. Define 'normal': erm, umm.

Again an astounding lack of logic! Wow! You must define what you say such that everyone agrees. Here you have used the phrase "sexual deviant". How in the hell do you define that? As someone who does something sexually that _you_ don't? By this definition you most probably mean the majority of the planet.

Many more have inadequate coverage, meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) In fact, one health care expert says that because only 1 percent of the population has private longterm-care insurance, "virtually any American could be impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness."(24) Additionally, as many as 40 percent of those eligible for some forms of public aid do not receive it. These gaps in health care result directly from the fact that the United States is the only major industrialized nation (other than South Africa) without a national health insurance plan providing universal coverage while controlling costs. ****************************************************************** From: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _We're Number One, Where America Stands -- and Falls -- in the New World Order_ by Andrew L Shapiro.

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (The White House) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers 4.20.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 693 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 9:47 A.M. EDT MS. MYERS: Okay, today's schedule. As you know, the President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford. At 1:15 p.m., he will have a photo opportunity in the Rose Garden to present the Teacher of the Year Award. At 1:30 p.m., he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia. And at 5:00 p.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel. There will be a photo op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards. Any questions? Q Is he moving towards some major decision this week on Bosnia? MS. MYERS: As we've said, he's continuing to discuss his options. He's been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors, his Bosnia advisors, as well as with other world leaders. He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll continue to discuss it. We don't have any specific timetable, but obviously the situation there is very serious. Q Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday? MS. MYERS: I don't believe he's spoken to her today. Q Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6:40 p.m.? MS. MYERS: He did. He answered a question about it yesterday. Q Before anything had happened. MS. MYERS: Before anything happened. He put out -- Q Since something has happened he's had nothing to say. MS. MYERS: He's put out a statement on it last night. And we'll have more to say about it later today. Q In what forum is that going to be? MS. MYERS: It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden. Q He will talk about Waco at that? MS. MYERS: Yes, he'll have something to say. Q Is that something we can take live? MS. MYERS: I think it will be brief. We can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out. But I don't know if it's something you'd want to take live. Q Will he take questions on Waco at that time as well? MS. MYERS: He'll probably take a few. Q Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the Attorney General? MS. MYERS: I'll have to double-check. I don't know that he hasn't talked to her this morning. Q And she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else? MS. MYERS: No. Q And he didn't talk yesterday? Q What's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night? MS. MYERS: She was asked a question about it, and she answered the question. The President has absolutely no intention of asking for the Attorney General's resignation. He stands behind her 100 percent. As you know, he was informed about the decision. He takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind Attorney General Reno. Q The question now arises -- yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this, but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing. Was he fully informed on all of that, all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now, the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed, et cetera? MS. MYERS: He talked with the Attorney General about the decision, about -- she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision. He raised no objections. He supports her decision to go forward with it. He was fully briefed. Q Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but looking back now, does the President, does the White House feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened? MS. MYERS: I think everybody feels bad when life is lost. But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the decision. He stands behind the decision that was made. He was informed about it. He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 percent behind the Attorney General, the Justice Department and the FBI. It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone on for more than seven weeks. Four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that. This was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult. But all the agents on the ground, the FBI, the Justice Department all recommended moving forward with this. They thought, given the circumstances, it was the best possible course of action. There's just no point in second- guessing those decisions. Now, I think that there's a reason -- Q Why not? They have to -- MS. MYERS: No, not to second-guess the decisions. I think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation. I think the President will talk some about that later today. But at this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, it's not useful. Q You sound like he's going to order an investigation of what happened and whether -- MS. MYERS: I think he'll have more to say about that later, yes. Q He will order an investigation? MS. MYERS: He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to say about an investigation. Q What kind of investigation? MS. MYERS: He'll have more to say about it later. Q But in the Monday morning quarterbacking, surely there is some soul-searching now as to whether it was the right decision. You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather -- a debacle. MS. MYERS: I think we'll -- obviously, we'll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome. I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic. But, again, the President stands behind the decisions that were made and we'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that. Q What was the FBI Director's role in this? MS. MYERS: Well, he was obviously involved in setting up the operation. He signed off on it, as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him. I don't believe he spoke to the President, but I'll double-check that. Q But he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth? MS. MYERS: I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what aspects he was involved with. Q Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House today? MS. MYERS: There's no planned meeting. I don't believe that she'll be here. Q She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.? MS. MYERS: No, no plans to be. Q Do you think that there's going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of -- to the President's detriment politically? MS. MYERS: Well, I would certainly hope that people wouldn't try to use this tragedy for political reasons. Obviously, I think, again, that it's useful to look at the facts, to reevaluate the facts, and I think the President will move forward with that. But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions; that it was a very difficult situation; that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents. And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in this. I don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome. Q Dee Dee, what was the White House role in handling the, I guess, public relations aspect in the aftermath? Who was talking -- who here at the White House was talking with people at Justice to set up Reno's news conference, to do all that sort of thing? MS. MYERS: I think the Attorney General handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information, I think, to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day. Obviously, people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening there. Q But Reno said that she didn't talk to the President, and there seemed to be an indication she hadn't talked to anybody at the White House. So who -- MS. MYERS: There were people talking on a staff-to- staff level. Q I understand. But who at the Justice Department was handling that for Reno? Who was talking to the White House? MS. MYERS: There were a number of people. As you know, Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House, and I know he talked to a number of people here. There were a number of people at a number of different levels involved. I don't want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom, but there were a number of conversations. Obviously, the Justice Department was working to keep the White House informed, the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day. Q Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. I don't know if he talked -- he may have at one point. Q And was the White House role just to seek information about what happened, or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed? MS. MYERS: It was both to keep abreast of the situation so the President could be on top of it, but I think the Justice Department managed its press relations on it. We were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day, and the President was following it very closely throughout the day. Q Dee Dee, on that, though, if the President was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet Reno, why wouldn't he talk to her at all since then? MS. MYERS: Again, I don't know if he's talked to her this morning. Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day. He stands 100 percent behind her decisions. He's been fully supportive of her, as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement. Q But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday? MS. MYERS: One more time, I don't know if they've spoken this morning. Q No, yesterday. Q Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday. MS. MYERS: That's just not true. I think we said throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility, that he stands -- I don't know how much clearer we can be. The President stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this. He accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired. He believes that Janet Reno, the Justice Department, and the FBI acted as best they could, given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time. I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 1,000 percent. Q One of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her. MS. MYERS: Again, I don't know whether they've spoken this morning. Q Why can't we find out? MS. MYERS: Well, we can. I can't do it standing here right now. Q You've got six people here. All they've got to do is pick up the phone. MS. MYERS: Helen, we'll get back to you. Q Dee Dee, when the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the Davidians? MS. MYERS: I think that they discussed the situation. Again, I'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him, but I think that he was aware of the risks involved. Q Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision. She then said that she told him what was happening and he said, okay. Does the President regard it that he gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead? MS. MYERS: I think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts. She informed him about that and he raised no objections. Again, I don't know how much clearer we can be about that. Q And he said, okay. The issue is over the responsibility. MS. MYERS: He said, okay. Q Does okay mean -- MS. MYERS: The President accepts ultimate responsibility. Q Dee Dee, the President's investigation that he's going to announce -- would that be conducted by someone outside the administration? MS. MYERS: No. Q It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation? MS. MYERS: No, it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday. Q And you would, I assume, therefore, cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held? MS. MYERS: To the best of our ability. Q Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning. One that the Justice Department, or FBI, or whomever, apparently had a bug planted inside the complex. And the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire. What do you know about those two -- MS. MYERS: Nothing more than I've seen in news accounts this morning. We may get more on it later, but at this point, I know -- I'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound. Q Has the President received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on -- what they've been able to find out on in the compound now? MS. MYERS: He's been briefed. I don't think that they've gotten into the compound yet. They were still waiting for it to cool off. I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news accounts. But he has been kept up-to-date on it. Q Dee Dee, the President stands behind Attorney General Reno, but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so-called experts? MS. MYERS: He believes that she made -- he stands behind the decision that she made. It was the unanimous decision of her advisors, of the FBI, of the agents on the ground, and he supports that. Q What about the validity of the decisions made on the ground? Does he back those -- MS. MYERS: He's not going to second-guess decisions made. Q Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the decision which she made. Normally, in a situation like this, the President says, I made the decision. But you're saying she made the decision? MS. MYERS: I'm saying that the President was briefed about the decision. He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it. Q But then why do you keep using the terminology, the decision that she made, rather than the decision that he made -- MS. MYERS: Because, as he said yesterday, she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department and FBI, which is part of the Justice Department, and made a decision and then briefed the President on that decision. That is how the chain of command works. She briefed him. He signed off on it. The operation went forward, and the President accepts full responsibility. Q In that chain of command analogy there, I want to go back to Sessions a moment. Do you know if this was a plan that came through him to Reno, or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement? What was his involvement? MS. MYERS: Again, you'd have to go to the Justice Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General and the Director. Q Does the President stand behind Director Sessions? MS. MYERS: He supports -- again, I don't know how many different ways I can say this -- he supports the decisions made by the Justice Department and the FBI. He fully supports the Attorney General in this. I'm not stepping away from the Director of the FBI, I want to -- but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him, the one who made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department. As you know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General. The Attorney General made the decision. She informed the President about those decisions. He okayed it. He didn't raise any objections to it, and he accepts full responsibility. Q Do you have, based on what you know here at the White House, any concerns about William Sessions' performance during this -- MS. MYERS: Nothing to suggest that, no. Q Along those same lines, just in your initial review of the situation, how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a Justice Department that's fully staffed and having an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status? MS. MYERS: I just don't think that had anything to do with it. I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went forward. I'm not going to speculate on that. Q Did the White House express any alarm that Janet Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to Clinton? MS. MYERS: No. She was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday. I think she did a very admirable job. The President agrees with that. Q Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed on the situation in Waco? MS. MYERS: He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a daily basis. Q Who briefed the President? MS. MYERS: Well, I'm not going to get into exactly who, what conversations he had with whom, but he was kept up-to-date on the events in Waco. He has daily briefings on a number of issues. Q No, no, was this a regular briefing conducted by a White House staff person, or was it by a Justice Department person? MS. MYERS: He's briefed regularly by a White House staff on a number of issues. Again, I'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects. Q Another subject? Q On another subject. Q Now we're going to do gays in the military. (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: I welcome it. Q How close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty? MS. MYERS: As you know, the President's giving a speech on Earth Day tomorrow. We'll have more to say about it then. Q Any details on where or when that speech is yet? MS. MYERS: It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where yet. Q Dee Dee, is this a major policy address? How would you characterize the speech tomorrow? MS. MYERS: I would characterize it as a Earth Day speech. I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these things. But, again, I don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about tomorrow. Q On or off campus? Q Is this at a location outside the White House? MS. MYERS: It will be somewhere in Washington. We don't know exactly where yet. Q Dee Dee, what foreign leaders has the President talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia? MS. MYERS: Only Prime Minister Major. And again, he'll try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning. Q David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today -- both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work, that the Serbs are not going to sign on. Does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on? MS. MYERS: Obviously, the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia. As you know, the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point. The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of Eastern Bosnia is quite serious. And the President will meet with his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this. Q Is that a question they're going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable? MS. MYERS: Again, they'll be reviewing a number of options, including the peace plan. Q Does the group that he's meeting with today include Reg Bartholomew? MS. MYERS: I don't believe he's here. But it will be among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General Powell. Q Dee Dee, do you have anything on the apparent encounter by U.S. F-15s over Bosnia today -- some aircraft violating the no-fly zone? MS. MYERS: No, I don't. I'll get back to you on that. Q Will the President be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum? MS. MYERS: He will. He'll be meeting, as you know, with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow, and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon. Q As a group, or one by one? MS. MYERS: I believe it's as a group. Now, Havel and Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time. But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here. Q Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act? And has anything been worked out for him to address the march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: I think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march. We haven't worked out the exact details of that. Q Not a live phone hook-up? MS. MYERS: Probably not, given the logistics of getting to Boston. The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m. The answer to the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on it. Q You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.? MS. MYERS: I believe so, yes. Q Do you know what it's on? MS. MYERS: We'll still working out -- Q General Vessey's coming back tonight from Vietnam. When will he be meeting with the President? MS. MYERS: No specific meeting is scheduled. We'll talk to him at some point and see. We look forward to his report, but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear. Q So he's not going to come immediately to the White House? MS. MYERS: No. Q The AIDS czar -- how close are you? MS. MYERS: Still working on it. Q Drug czar? Q Do you expect it before the march? MS. MYERS: I don't have a time line on it. Q Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Q Why not? MS. MYERS: He's just not going to. Q Are Senate Democrats here at this hour? MS. MYERS: No, that's tomorrow -- tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Q Update on the stimulus, possible scaling down -- MS. MYERS: As you know, the Senate will vote on amendments today. We'll continue to talk. The President is committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed. And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up. Q When this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the President's talked to Janet Reno? MS. MYERS: We'll be happy to. Q It's become a pressing question for the last several hours. MS. MYERS: No, just this minute that I've been here, and I haven't had a chance to follow up on it, Helen. Q Does he have an opinion on Hatfield? MS. MYERS: I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered a compromise package of $12.2 billion. He believes that that's the best alternative, believes that he's obviously willing to take a second look at the package. And I think the Senate will vote on that today, and we're hopeful that the President's bill, which will be the Mitchell amendment, will be the one that will be approved. Q Dee Dee, is there any White House official that will be at the march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: Somebody will be there representing the President. I don't know who yet.

In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family farm. Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing not only agricultural goods but also "manufactured" goods, especially cloth. Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income. But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form of textile mills. These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently and cheaply than people at home. The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis- eases due to the work. Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth. They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support their local economy . . . > Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system >and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit. . . . but (sorry for the cliche), "it takes two to tango". The big rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff. It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also its social center. You KNEW the merchants you did business with or even local kids working behind the counter. You would see people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat. Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of thousands or millions. You have no particular relationship with the companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment to them, nor they to you. Major components of what defines a "com- munity" have been destroyed. On the other hand the products we buy at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent, quality. > I have to >constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make >money.

When the sheriff came to arrest him, the sheriff knocked on the dorr and showed Koresh the warrant (a tactic that the BATF might try learning).

EDT Q Mr. President, President Havel is here for the Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night. All this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision- making process as far as Bosnia is concerned? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the Holocaust is the most extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing. And I think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that should be opposed. You couldn't help thinking about that. That's not to compare the two examples. They're not identical; everyone knows that. But I think that the United States should always seek an opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against inhumanity. Q Sir, how close are you to a decision on more sanctions on Bosnia? THE PRESIDENT: Well, of course, we've got the U.N. vote. Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough. And we now are putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at what other options we ought to consider. And I don't have anything else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on it and will continue to over the next several days. Q Following your meeting today, sir, are you any closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there? THE PRESIDENT: I have not made any decisions. * * * Q President Clinton, why have you decided to meet with Mr. Havel? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm just honored that he would come and see me. I'm glad he's here in the United States for the dedication of the Holocaust Museum. He is a figure widely admired in our country and around the world, and a very important person in Europe, and a very important person to the United States. So I'm hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we believe in. END5:05 P.M. EDT

Pointing fingers is a destructive action. If everyone sat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get done and nothing would ever get any better. And despite the tragedy, we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a constructive manner. Doesn't it seem that working together is more productive than working against one another? Thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of. Why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had - in a very, very difficult situation.

What is your proof that they "did the best they could"? Unless they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger then "the best they could" have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT. Some of us DID predict this outcome, or at least suggested a strong possibility of it. I, for one, said that in the event of an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger either from the assault itself or from a "Jonestown" (my phrase a week after the seige started) style suicide. And as I pointed out then, and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net who disagreed with me, an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their children. Now, while I don't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I have to say on this, I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of experts. The cult specialist inter- viewed in yesterday's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly "stonewalled" by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational tactics played perfectly into Koresh's mad view of the world and so increased the chance of a tragic outcome. >Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were >done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give >me a break. Give *US* a break! Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound filled with CHILDREN?!! This doesn't seem to show much regard for their lives or safety. "Nontoxic teargas" is an oxymoron. Children have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions induced by teargas; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone subject to laryngospasms, asthma, or heart disease. If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage, someone who provokes the madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage as the madman himself. These kinds of situations have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud- speakers at all hours. That approach is idiotic. >Be part of the solution - not the problem. The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the "the authorities". The Feds showed themselves here, as they have so many times in the past, to be a gang of trigger-happy, impulsive, yahoos who cause more trouble than they prevent. Their confrontational approach reinforced every single message Koresh was giving his followers, virtually guarantee- ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed willingly. This was pointed out here, on Compuserve, in the press, just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems a n.i.h. philosophy prevails. ---peter

Q Can I ask you a series of questions about the way the President handled the notifications yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. Q Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Why don't we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the Justice Department and the White House. As you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon. They had a good discussion, about 15 minutes. The Attorney General informed the President of what she wanted to do. He raised no objections. Obviously, she had the implicit authority from the President to go forward. He raised no objections. She went forward. They had a discussion of a general nature about the incident. Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the President spoke with the Attorney General again. They had a brief discussion over what was happening in Waco. As you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound. And I think that was why there was some -- just some confusion. I think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day when they spoke. Then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the Justice Department and the White House. They were informing us of their decisions, what they would like to do. There was an FBI briefing in Waco. The Attorney General had her press conference. The President then issued a statement after that. Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground. Once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a statement. He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday evening. Q At what hour was that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was quite late. I believe it was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum. He took a tour of the Holocaust Museum last night. Q And he went out to dinner. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe briefly. Yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night. I don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late. And he just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try and get some sleep. He then, again, spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this afternoon. As you know, the President will have an announcement to make at 1:15. Q Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge, no. Q Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Webb Hubbell is the general White House Liaison and several people talked to Webb. The Attorney General was running the operation. Q Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job? Or he just tell her that she should get some sleep? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think sleep well -- done a good job -- I don't know the exact words. I think that sounds right. Q I mean, sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean, I think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when -- Q I understand that, but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that. The spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation yesterday. And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best as she could and -- Q Well, does he think it was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend. Q Does he think the situation was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President -- Q In retrospect? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the Attorney General. He accepts full responsibility. At the same time, I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen again, or at least we know how to handle it. Q How much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with? I know that she made the case to him -- explained -- outlined the case for action. Did she say to him on Sunday precisely what action? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen. I think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action. I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered. But it wasn't minute-by-minute detail of how the operation -- Q Well, was it, "we are going in." Is it, "we're going to use tear gas"? I mean, what? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out. Q George, was there ever a conscious political decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President from -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, we were in close contact with the Justice Department. The President accepts responsibility for this. At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made. It is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations. The Attorney General has operational control over this. The President obviously accepts responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney General. Q George, there was a report on the television today -- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire and not themselves. There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out. And my question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: All the evidence we have is that this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have. Q Did the President ask the Attorney General why do this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know the specific questions. He had general questions about how the decision was going about being made. Q Those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he asked, have you considered all of the consequences; have you considered the recommendations? I don't know if he asked the question, "why now? " I don't know if he asked that specific question. Q Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I'm not certain how much specific detail they got into. I know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the decision she's prepared to make. It's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved. Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that. Q What is the President's understanding why yesterday? One of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action. Why yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: This is the first I've heard. I think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has said. There were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger. It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all. There was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work. And as the Attorney General has said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a concern over the safety. All of these factors came into play. They also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on David Koresh and those in the compound. I would just go back to what the Attorney General has said. You have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time. They did. Obviously, we all regret the loss of life. It's a terribly unfortunate situation. We all wish it could have turned out differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were made at the time. Q George, when did the President know that they were going to use tear gas? Was it before the assault on the compound? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just don't know. I don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go. I just don't know. Q Along that point, George, can you say whether the plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it. Q Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, I think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever. Q George, was there a 12-hour gap between conversations between the President and the Attorney General? In other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again until Clinton got back from dinner at -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's likely, yes. Q Did he call her? What time did she call? Was there a gap between when she called him? I mean, was he at dinner when she called and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no, no. I think he called her last night. I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last night. He just wanted to talk to her. Q what was going on? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not that I know of, no. Q What do you know about the situation now? Everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine? And do you know any of the other details? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know any more details than the FBI reported in Waco. Q watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what is going on? If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was he keeping track of what was going on here? I mean, with all due respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. There was also -- as I said, several people in the White House were in constant contact with their counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information. Q Who were those contacts? I mean, was it Mack McLarty, Webb Hubbell? How was the President being kept informed? That's not a -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe Mack was in contact with Webb. I spoke with several people at the Justice Department. I believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department. Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the Justice Department. We were fully briefed and fully informed. Q We were told this morning that the President may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb. Do you know if that's true or not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think there's a chance he may have. I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point. I don't believe he did. I think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with the Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the Attorney General. But the White House was fully informed on a minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was happening at the Justice Department. Q George, who decided that the briefing would be done by the Attorney General? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General. Q Did you or did the White House communications staff -- were you ever involved with that decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. We were told about it. Q Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil- Lehrer and all that stuff? Was that part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q there was no advice from the White House at all about her -- she was on all night, all day. (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, and she did a very good job. Q Why did you decide to have the President's reaction to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not having him appear as personally saying anything? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that wasn't the intent at all. As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand. The President is also making a statement today. The President made a statement yesterday morning. The President has been fully involved -- Q After this turned into less than a successful operation, the only statement from the President was what was on paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to the major facts in this. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it was the first statement from the President, not the only statement from the President, number one. Q After the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Number two -- well, the first. Number two, the Attorney General -- Q He gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. And he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today. Now, the second point -- Q It just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved? It was the President wants to put out a written statement? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Knowing what we knew at the time, we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the Attorney General's -- Q Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he did personally do so. That is his statement. It's a statement under his name. Q George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't say the President took full responsibility for what happened -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I certainly did. Q No, what you said was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's just not right, Susan. Q Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I mean, unless I miss something -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'd love to. Q Janet Reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the President takes responsibility. Absolutely. Q Took responsibility -- all right. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Check the transcript. Q Considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why is Washington calling this a mass suicide? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his control. Q It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that that is an entirely different matter. I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely. But he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did. Q You're still operating completely on assumption, right? I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of those inside. Q I didn't quite hear it. This might be Ann's question, I didn't quite hear it. But at what time did Clinton himself put out a statement on this? I know Dee Dee said some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m. Q Right after the evening news went on the air? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, right when we had all the information. We were working on it. Q Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an administration-run investigation. Why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have already been -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that clearly the ATF and the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the investigation. That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well. But it will be run by the Treasury and Justice. Q Are you confident that you will not have any problem getting -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Q George, did the President reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno? And who else in the White House sat in on that meeting? Anyone else from Justice? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe anybody else was there at the time. It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a meeting. Q Sunday. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sunday. It was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting. I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General. Q George, you said that in that phone call, she said that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force him out. What did he think she was talking about? If he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on -- qQ It didn't matter how she did that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no. I mean -- Q What information did he have in terms of how this would proceed? Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute- by-minute, but in a general sense -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies. I just don't know -- Q What is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the recommendation -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The action to increase pressure. I don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure. I just don't know. Q It's hard to imagine him not asking, though. Q that Janet Reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He was -- he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave. At the same time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved. Q George, it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere. Can you take that question and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Yes. Q get the answer and come back to us with all of it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be on all of these television broadcasts? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Never. Never. Q And you never called the Justice Department and said to anyone or Janet Reno, "you're the one who needs to be out front explaining this"? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not once. Q It just happened that way that she was the spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: She made a decision as Attorney General that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident. Q She had no guidance from the White House at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly didn't object. Q But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it? Was this a plan -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Absolutely not. Q a strategy? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she clear it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she notify you? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly knew about it. Q What happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the Justice Department? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General made the decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward. It seemed like a good decision. It was a good decision. She did a good job. Q Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how you would handle it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was handled very well. Q You wouldn't change a thing if -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Change what? Q The way the White House handled any part of it -- from start to finish. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that's an awful broad question and we're certainly going to have a review. One of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them. If you're talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, there -- wouldn't make any change at all. Q Two questions: First of all, on her going on TV, no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this idea? It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: How so? Q I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline after the draft story; watching Clinton on -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: There's absolutely no comparison. Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident. The incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people. The Attorney General was involved in that decision. The Attorney General made the decision to do that. She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she did a fantastic job. Q The second question is, did -- as someone who knows Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do? In other words, she came and she said, I'm going to put pressure on them. It's hard not to see Clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how. Q What kind? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Both the Attorney General said that he did ask questions, he did ask general questions. I don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation. Q How long a conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was about 15 minutes. Q Telephone conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe so, no. Q George, you keep saying that the President takes full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision. Does the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is ultimately his decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know what this has to do with Commander-In-Chief. This was a law enforcement action, not a military action. And he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government. I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that. Q But is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision? There's a difference. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As a matter of fact, it was her decision. He did not object to that decision. He clearly takes full responsibility. Q George, this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged. What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general? That's a long period of time in a phone conversation. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It is an awful long phone conversation. It was a very important phone conversation. I think Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would. Q One of the things Reno said last night is that the buck stops here. I think that was her direct quotation. Does the President agree with that in this case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President says he accepts full responsibility. I think what the Attorney General was saying is that she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her. And she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the President. Q At any point in the conversation last night between the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever offer her a resignation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge. Q Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation. Is the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And I don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation. We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation. Q In what forum will you answer Brit's question? Will you put out a written statement? Will you -- the wires? How will you answer the question that you've taken? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. Q George, can you remind us what the President was doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was involved in? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'll have to try and remember. He had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon. He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and getting periodic reports on that as well. He did see some on CNN as well. I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as well. Q And those reports would have come to him from Mack McLarty, would they -- do you think? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to him, I talked to him. Q George, to follow Helen's question, in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign? Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that? I'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this? Did that come up at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if it even came up that specifically. I know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation -- Q The didn't talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I believe she was asked a question. Q And her response was, if the President wants me to, I will. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Which would be, I think, the standard response that most Cabinet members would give. I mean, it's a conditional statement. Q have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the President wanted her -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they talked about it. I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself. And this just didn't come up. I did not ask the question if they talked about -- Q Will you take that with the Brit package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Certainly. (Laughter.) Q George, for the record, does the President want her to resign? I know Dee Dee answered this morning -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not. He supports Janet Reno. She's a good Attorney General. She's done a good job. She handled a difficult situation extremely well. Q George, does the President feel that he and Janet Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And the President is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way. That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life. Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation. But the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had. Q George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on Sunday, is that correct? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. I'll take that question, too. Q Were these outside experts that they were consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: You'd have to ask them. I'm just not sure. I know that there were several experts. Q And also, why weren't there replacements for these people? Is the unit that small? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I think it is a very small highly-specialized unit. But I think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine. Q George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI Director? Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the Attorney General. I know the chain of command. But presidents talk to their FBI directors. In this case, throughout this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he talked to the FBI Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in Waco. At the same time, the Attorney General bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the Attorney General. Q Don't you think the ambiguous situation that Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and that's following the chain of command. THE PRESS: Thank you . END 1:03 P.M. EDT #60-04/20

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Please be seated. I want to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham. The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving. There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year. And I think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom. That's why today's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important. Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs. He's developed and introduced into Florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I might add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's Capital. (Laughter.) Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national and international awards. These advanced programs aren't just for a favored few. Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it. This is what our students need and what our country needs. Today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime. The basics aren't enough anymore. All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving. That's why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments. Tracey, you represent the best in the United States. I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993. (Applause.) MR. BAILEY: Thank you, Mr. President. It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers. And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools. We know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come. And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education. Thank you again. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: In closing, I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come. I'd like to recognize Tracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education. And I'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America. They are, in so many ways, our most important public servants. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END1:29 P.M. EDT

You want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls be odd balls? (I know, this requires tolerance for those that go into Government - but we all know people who have no useful skills.) ith the death of the children everybody is getting real upset - what about the other 40 plus people? I suppose that you consider children to be property of the state with the family as custodians. (In the States its the other way around - children are parental property.) If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that you send you children into _their_ tender care - I suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children over to their care.

But apart from that little |> conundrum... This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution. One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while. Another approach is to try and amend the constitution. The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship. I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen). Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable. That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se. If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now. This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus. -- Ervan Darnell ervan@cs.rice.edu

It would if malpractice and "defensive medicine" were the main factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't. Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall difference in health care costs. (They do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.) Some facts. Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of total health care costs in the US. In 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance. Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985; they've declined significantly since then. At the same time, health care costs have increased more than any period in history. As far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its total impact is about $7 billion per year. That's about 8% of the total current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care. As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however, Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties. This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice. jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism? Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's tapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that there is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.

Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to give you a polite responce. Something atypical of the net, but here it goes. Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King. From many of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective is commonly in front of his name. I have NEVER seen anyone complain about the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner. I did not say that Mr. King was a no good black! I do not know Mr. King and would not make this ascertian without some evidence to this effect. I used it PURELY as a descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have used it in the past. The entire second trial was about race, Ted. I don't feel compelled to discuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would not have been a second trial. You probably are saying that the beating would not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call to make. It is possible the case, but not definately. I still think your actions are crap, Ted. They are far more divisive than me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner. Would you have been happier if I had used 'African-american' ? If so, then you really are lost in the world of PC. You have already been instrumental in getting one persons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.

I don't want to seem patronizing, but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.

Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking: In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities. In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into one giant S&L, waiting to blow. Short-term rates rise ---> Interest payments on Deficit rise ---> Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ----> Causing Short-term rates to rise. Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop. His options: i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount ii) Make truly unimaginable spending cuts Results of i): large numbers of pissed-off citizens Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots uprising.

Organization: Youngstown State/Youngstown Free-Net Lines: 28 NNTP-Posting-Host: yfn.ysu.edu I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there are! Such arguments are basically worthless, imho. Would it really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or even only one? As for death threats, I happen to know from personal experience that gay people are far more likely to receive them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex uals. Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to be gay. Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under our current form of government in theory, yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments, by the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed and ignorant public. Is this democracy? I don't think so. A society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of the treatment of the people who make up that society. All of those people. And yes, that includes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are a part. -- Frank Jordan [D[D[D[C[C[C Gay Arab Bassoonists UNITE!!!

You asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer? I believe a legitimate question was asked. Why shouldn't cost and safety be used (at least in part) to determine legality? I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea. Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that drug legalization is a good idea.

I'm curious if there was an additional >level of distinction made by the slave states to rationalize their >treatment of slaves, or if they just ignored the theoretical >problems of slave ownership. The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to "citizens", but it makes several references to "people". For example, Article IV: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ... nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted". Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens; aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.? Whether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seems that a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as defined in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness", it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity. ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610

From a pragmatic standpoint, there certainly is some justification if it is a vice people will commit anyway. Shall we criminalize alcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from anything other than the pragmatic standpoint, I'd be happy to hear about it. The fact is that it wasn't. > A few more ideas to hold to these criterion - prostitution; the killing of all > funny farm patients, AIDS "victims", elderly, unemployed, prisioners, etc. - > this would surely make my taxes decrease. Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to "legalize" about all the rest. Just in case you haven't made the connection (which I expect you haven't) the connecting theme in this thread is a persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous for the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however, take autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government says. And why, pray tell, is AIDS "victim" in snear quotes?

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds. In this case, "limited" and "big" government are not defined. I would point out that Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western Europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view. The argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those who want "unlimited" government. It is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds. jsh >-- >Paul Schmidt: Advocates for Self-Government, Davy Crockett Chapter President -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so. Think about it. If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.

Look at the whole picture, not just randomly picked libertarian positions. If government is not allowed to use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf. The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I'll address briefly. It certainly won't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy. What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy? Statists run the education monopoly, so we have to be creative. The Advocates for Self-Government reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism. That's the best means I've seen yet.

The ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis have forgotten) is "I do not care if you are either a man or a woman, I do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay or straight." Once you can honistly say "I do not care about color, race, or gender or sexual preference", then we will truly be on the right track. Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along? Get real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female, or whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour. But the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend money, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say "I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences; I instend instead to treat you as a human being," crap like last year's riots will continue to happen. >1. HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!! Barf. You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sake of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is no wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in real life? Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter of that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there in chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following: "As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation, especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently the province of individuals who create new inventions and discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this book that there is no wealth creation. "We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world, however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested." So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an idea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple things. To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job. - Bill Woody Normally I don't post (or even read most of the postings) in this newsgroup.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to have "a positive view" of one's self.

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting). Those acquittals seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al. However ... Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-; Also, some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb move, obviously). And, Koreans are still scared and certain people are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year. A Commander from Nassau, Long Island was questioned about how his people would have handled Rodney King, and he said "We'd have let him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired, then handcuff him". gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with. In article <1993Apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay) writes: |>As Dawidowicz points out, in "The Holocaust and the Historians," (Harvard |>University Press, 34-38): |> |>"...the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving's "Hitler's |>War."<34> An amateur historian, whose reputation as a German apologist and |>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of |>notoriety, <35> Irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that Hitler |>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was "probably the |>weakest _leader_ Germany has known in this century," and that he did not |>murder the Jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed |>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent." Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter? One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric. This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz. The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness. It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide. The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary. No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology. It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security. Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot affect the system. Phill Hallam-Baker Phill Hallam-Baker

This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S. (Our non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate). It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws. I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily. >Given that most >criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who >purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does >seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes. Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.

(Well, it makes sense to some of us, anyway. ;-) The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there. >>If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would >>realize that: >> -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue > >Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and >Vancouver, B.C.

And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related. That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical. The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities. That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went. They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions. If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle. Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower. >> -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city > >Surprise.

The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city" problems are not mirrored in Canada. As such if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable. (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since. Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties. >> -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already > >Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Those areas implemented gun control because of >the high rates. True only to a certain extent. Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards. Similarly for New York. The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low. Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime. Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it. Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime. But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada. >Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control. As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control. >And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in >Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there. Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters. But let's be honest about something, here. When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments? Or are they simply propogranda? We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince. >|> Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and >|>probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. >|>But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions >|>on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the >|>government? > >I don't propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions. >Thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today. > >Their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though, only their >arguments. These are true or false regardless of who said them or why. If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?" That would seem to be irrelevent. >The >difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their >arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies. Oh, I have no argument with questioning them. I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments. I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them. >If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to >express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary >and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required.

Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change. In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition. It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-) >|> If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than >|>we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. >|>(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much >|>greater power than did the American system). > >In principle no, in practice yes.

Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses. While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President. Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less. Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in? >|> I disagree.

These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level >instead. Not at all. As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want. With national "interest groups" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states. Less people to persuade, and less "contributions" to make. Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level? Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension. The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions. Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests. Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government. Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower. I mean, let's get real here. Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern? Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime? The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell" it to them for their votes. I don't think the rise of "special interests" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress. >|> Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than >|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its >|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy. > >If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current >"no state subsidy motto" they would be better placed. As it is there is >plenty of state money being handed out. The problem is that it is >distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of >actual need. Bingo. The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness. >In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the >other 49 states with pork - defense contracts, agricultural subsidies etc. >Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster. Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York? I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do. And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that state. And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact. The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork. >|> It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically >|>wanted to avoid.

You said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress. If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced. >The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility >to come to a decision. The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action. Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing. >Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse, >not better. The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate. And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once. You get to see them tried out without a national decision. Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for. And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off. I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents. I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt. >|> I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were >|>placed on the veto.

Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers. We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill. You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers. You argued against them, I never argued from them. I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House. >The >US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work. The >only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where >the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous. The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document. The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning. (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.) >That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the >fact of the senate.

To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended. However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say. Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse. >|> There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power >|>regarding what a bill is for.

Why not? What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action? Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.

No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*. Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about. And 41% is hardly a tiny minority. I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

The trap is the easy way out. For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement. If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans. It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot! In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression. I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors, luck in avoiding the "trap".

The government provides free health care to all U.S. >residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. Wrong. In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments. France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages. For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate. The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance. So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes. The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S. That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is). The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these). I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that). Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc. The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture. >Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two >elements of the current health care system that reformers most often >criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the >employer-based system of coverage.

"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings. In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals. It is all pure insurance without HMO's. The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked "sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.) With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy. gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March). Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany? Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service. >"`You've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's >not as obvious.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand. I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places. However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc. Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine. There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private. >WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS? > >In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40 >a month. Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector. They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care. At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff. >****************************************************************** > >WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY >ACHE AND PAIN? > >People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical >bills. > >Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower >per-person health bill than we do. It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is). I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate). Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda. The French do have copayments, though. France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages. For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.

The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care. You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market. When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility. In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan. gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S. The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

EDT Q For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News. We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton. And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Glad to be here. Q There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles. I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers. We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty. It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict. And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do. THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case. The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated. The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating. The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie. No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here. They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated. And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that. But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things: first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime. I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime. It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs. And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas. If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do. And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities. I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country. I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country. Q Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today. There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package. You've been locked in a battle with the GOP. Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock. What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle? THE PRESIDENT: Well, there are two reasons. First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy. We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12. We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country. But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more. The plan passed the House. It has the support of a majority of the Senate. At the present time, all the Republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill. That is, they won't let it come to a vote. I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill. And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched. And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit. It doesn't. This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year. This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years. This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy. And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs. So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam. I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise. But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country. And that's the purpose of the bill. Q Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented. You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more. But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years. And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year. And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work. So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue. It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs. Q I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration. It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears. A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through. Look at these problems. Look at this gridlock. And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off? And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this. THE PRESIDENT: Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast. The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets. So we are moving really rapidly. And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things. But it's a big operation. You can't expect to turn it around overnight. It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days. But I think we're making real, real progress. I would urge the people not to get discouraged. We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight. But we are definitely moving and changing things. Q Thank you very much. The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport. I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. My voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh. I'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs, health care and the economy. But I wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the American people. I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year's presidential elections. Over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last year's campaign. Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and what I'm doing to try and solve them. It's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable. You sent me to Washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics. You know how important it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do business. We live in a competitive global economy. Nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business, labor and government. Although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored. That's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind. We have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs. We've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to show for it. We know that wages of most working people have stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care. But we also know that, given the right tools, the right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live. In many critical products today Americans are the low cost, high quality producers. Our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs. Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth. It changes the old priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future. These new directions passed the Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country. Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives. It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the Senate, just 43 senators. They blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs. The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it, counting on us in Washington. But the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock. I know the American people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual. I know they don't want us to spin or wheels. They want the recovery to get moving. So I have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile. Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion. It's not what I'd hoped for. With 16 million Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people. The mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward. By taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals. First, we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs, including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young people, immunization for children, construction of waste water sites, and aid to small businesses. We also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs. Second, I've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent. And third, I've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people. I'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it. Now, the people who are filibustering this bill -- the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this year that hasn't already been approved. That sounds reasonable, doesn't it? Here's what they don't say. This program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the Congress this year. It's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the American people to work. This is not about deficit spending. We have offered a plan to cut the deficit. This is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics. Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar. It is paid for by budget cuts. And it's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children. I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we've helped make more American partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy. You know, if every American who wanted a job had one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today. This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again. But it's a step we ought to take. And it is fully paid for over the life of our budget. Tell your lawmakers what you think. Tell them how important the bill is. If it passes, we'll all be winners. Good morning, and thank you for listening. END 10:11 A.M. EDT

Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac. In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars. In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars. In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars. In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for. (This represented an increase of 230%) In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars. In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started. (This represented an increase of 230%) In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare. In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars. (an increase of 368%) In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like. In 1992 it was 87 billion. In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars. In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars. Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion. Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion. Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion. Education up 14 billion to 45 billion. Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion. Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion. About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development," in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

From your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction. Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us. Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it werent' so damn typical. Peace - Aaron

In almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it. I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack of money in the state. (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country. *I* see a correlation.) 1) What money we spend goes primarly to administration. The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue. And 2) the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis" in order to push for his pet income tax. Some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing. It's not a lack of funds. It's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate. Education is *the* parental hot-button. Education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art. >|> The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.

Theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but aren't "urgent" at all. The problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions? I bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any hospital's "urgent" care list no matter how minor your problem.

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the second least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, "the services they expect from the province just won't be there in a few years" (Fortunately for them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I knew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the truth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no obligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling such basic services, too). > >>****************************************************************** >> >>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY >>ACHE AND PAIN? >> >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about >>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical >>bills. >> >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower >>per-person health bill than we do. > >It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two >things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like >real health insurance -- which actually it is).

Again, I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power.

But it's another possibility). They'd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more strongly related. In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining. What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible. If "poverty (were) the main engine of social instability," this typical historical pattern would not hold. In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

The United States, with its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional protections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such as 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al. With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the form of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. Though it can be said that white people numerically commit more crimes in the United States, because white people are a majority, it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their numbers in population.

Geez, where have you been, Ryan? I proposed this theory *months* ago. Let's take it one step further, even. If, as the surveys show, up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies. But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential. Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or, more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual. Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category. These people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice." Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are just flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with what society has dictated. Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts. I chose, I gleefully admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to indulge in my homoerotic potential. Take that!

Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't. The Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed against the government, but one of its citizens. That all being true, what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some initiation of force on its part is really a response?

Fine. Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion. The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists. For example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith? Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it? Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion? > >The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic >which I'll address briefly.

I'd venture to point out, however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group of "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their propaganda skills need to be honed. Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy. Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc. And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away. On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until everyone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular "seminar" training? jsh > >Roger Collins -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

None of them are serious on the USA scale. And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism. The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up.

What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed.

The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly. What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election.

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with Iran. The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move. First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests. The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need western technology. Phill Hallam-Baker

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. Phill Hallam-Baker

What kind of witnesses? If we are talking about witnesses who were at the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics, emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the first trial. You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and forgot to call all of your witnesses. If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find such witnesses. If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new expert witnesses). --Tim Smith

Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?

I disagree. The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle. As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), "Congress has become everybody's city council." Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy. It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid. Namely, a concentration of power. It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels. All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things. It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level. >|> On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be >|>some sort of rubber-stamp for the House?

Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an "extraordinary" manner. >The veto was clearly regarded >as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to >preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive. I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto. It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies. There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for. Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda. I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos. >the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as >a check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into >the constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives >of the states is not a reasonable restriction. Why is it not a reasonable restriction? Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based? If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it? Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions? Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required? Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored. I do not see this as a positive thing. And for all that I'm sure the Republicans are looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct. I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the "right" things (where "right" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of "myopic social perspective", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity. Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public. Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the "oughta-be's" inside their own hopelessly closed minds. > The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening >pages of both books.

Hmmm, "Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Liberal translation: "the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others." I think Limbaugh has you on this one. It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion. Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

For >example: This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh is the populist nemesis of that movement. I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain "venom" at all, let alone "venom" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism. >On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society > Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who >individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly >perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in >order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of >imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight >for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of >thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" >(page 577).

(pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.) You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included. You yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator. I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated. >On Religion as the Basis of a Nation > Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are >inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan.

He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord >sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the >expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.) This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race. Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine. > Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... >But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or >ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools >for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of >American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.) Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools. American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian. I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race. I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here. >On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse > Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... >One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... >Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the >service of a moral idea of State and culture."

The reason [is] that >Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people >who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality >and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.) Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood. You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this. I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control of Hollywood. 90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the "right" way to view religion and morality. I believe Mr. Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full of mush" hyperbole indicates. >On the News Meida > Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of >gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass >by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of >slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.) Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy. > Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the >bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During >the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global >network.

If they don't >realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided >and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.) Indication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias. Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal. You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters. Who is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh? Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media. >* * * >To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading. It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred. As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business. Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through "business/government partnership" and increased levels of taxation. Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school. > And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the >radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only >wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on. Hmmm. Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism. I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh. The only place I hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal Left. The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc. The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter. It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton. >The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701- >0845; (608) 255-4460. > >--- 30 --- This is the same address as "Idiots Anonymous", isn't it?

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86 blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors: 1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor. One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings. Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former. 2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point. There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save on taxes." In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal). It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest. Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world. -- MORAL: Always Choose the Right Sort of Parents Before You Start in to be Rough - George Ade Mark Eckenwiler eck@panix.com ...!cmcl2!panix!eck

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen. While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances. >Just >as Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and >the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how >weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human >condition.

If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No? Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle and Socrates believed was the best.

But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must be the PRIMARY goal of any organization. >Ian Sutherland >ian@eecs.nwu.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Authur.

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (Clinton/Gore '92) Subject: CLINTON: AM Press Briefing by Dee Dee Myers -- 4.15.93 Organization: Project GNU, Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 844 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 9:45 A.M. EDT Q Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? MS. MYERS: Just due to scheduling conflicts. So as we put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to 10:00 a.m. The only other things on his schedule today are: At 11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue. At 12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval Office. And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the various groups. Q A photo op with Vessey? MS. MYERS: There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting. Q Why? MS. MYERS: Why? It's a closed meeting. Q What about the lunch? MS. MYERS: The lunch? No, there's no coverage. Q Is he meeting with any congress people today? MS. MYERS: Nothing scheduled. Q There are no meetings -- MS. MYERS: There are no congressional meetings today, no. Q Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi? Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject? MS. MYERS: Well, clearly, the report is the first order of business. It's high on the agenda on something that they'll discuss. I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report yet. Certainly, it's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about first. Q Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package? MS. MYERS: He spoke with Senator Dole. Q How many times? MS. MYERS: I believe once during the day and once last night. Q What was the outcome of that? MS. MYERS: They're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package. Q Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this? MS. MYERS: Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement. Q Did they discuss the VAT tax? MS. MYERS: I don't know if that came up. Q Can you check that? MS. MYERS: Sure. Q So what are they -- is the President offering to scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down to where Dole will sign on? MS. MYERS: Well, he's trying to protect as much of it as he can. But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress now. And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know. But at the moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress including, obviously, Senator Dole. Q Is he talking to anybody else? MS. MYERS: I don't believe he talked to any other Republicans yesterday. Q Is he talking to anybody today? MS. MYERS: I don't think anything is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out. Q We were led to believe that the President called Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package. Is that correct? MS. MYERS: I think the President has contacted several people on Russian aid. I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator Dole. The primary objective of the conversation was Russian aid. That was the first order of business, but it was both. Q In the President's mind, are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people? Has he made that argument? MS. MYERS: I can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made. The President is obviously committed to both. He liked to see a jobs package to the American people first. But as you know, we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Tokyo. Q But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid? MS. MYERS: I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the Congress. Q Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole? MS. MYERS: He's discussing options with him. Q On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they had earlier for the package, the stimulus package? MS. MYERS: I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs package. Q But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other than Shelby? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. There hasn't been a vote. Q What about Kohl? Q Kohl and Feingold? MS. MYERS: There hasn't been a vote yet. And we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the package. Q If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day? MS. MYERS: I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't pass. Q No Democrats. (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: I'll let you draw your own conclusions. Q Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today? MS. MYERS: There's nothing specifically scheduled, but again, I wouldn't rule it out. Q Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today? MS. MYERS: What we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state. I think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package. Q Will you share those with us? MS. MYERS: Sure. As we did yesterday. Q Do you have copies of the ones you sent -- MS. MYERS: Yes, we made those available yesterday. And we certainly can continue to provide them today. Q Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has been given? MS. MYERS: Nothing's changed since yesterday. I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add to that. Q But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it. Can you tell us -- MS. MYERS: I think that there has been -- I'm not going to speculate on who supports it. I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor groups. I don't think he said he was directly contacted by them. Q Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this -- MS. MYERS: I think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think I want to add to that. Q In February, though, the President said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road. What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind? MS. MYERS: I think as we said yesterday, it is something that the working groups are looking at. They're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President's health care plan. The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision on it. And beyond that, I don't have anything to add. Q You haven't answered the question. It wasn't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President's comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing. Q And then suddenly -- Q What happened? MS. MYERS: The working groups, as we have said throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board. And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax. Q But the President himself took this off the table, Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears. And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way. What has happened in the meantime? MS. MYERS: The President has not looked at this, it hasn't been presented to him, again, yet. The working groups are looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and no decisions have been made. Q And it raises the question of how independently the task force is working. MS. MYERS: The task force was instructed to consider all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all options. Q But that's not the impression that the President left in February. The impression he left was that this was something that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road. The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table, not an option. Q "If it changes I'll tell you." Q Bring him on. Q And you repeatedly referred to the President's remarks, telling us that those were still in operation. MS. MYERS: It's changed, and we told you. (Laughter.) Q But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna Shalala comments were about. I mean, that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers -- MS. MYERS: I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a Cabinet member, first of all. Second of all, it was not orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at. We confirmed that yesterday. And I don't have anything to add to that. Q Is it because he has very few options? Q Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about? In other words, has the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table? Or is it, in fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with the President? MS. MYERS: It is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the President of anything. It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options. I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on. Q They will present it to him as one of his options, though he specifically ruled it out? MS. MYERS: Correct. Q Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon? Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation? MS. MYERS: It's simply a statement of fact. The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform. One of the options that they're looking at is the VAT. Q Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not? MS. MYERS: I don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is. I don't know. Q Who was telling you that it was not under consideration? MS. MYERS: I was referring back to the President's comments. Q Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package? MS. MYERS: No, there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan. Q I'm asking whether the projections -- MS. MYERS: There's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured. You can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like. And so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know. Q Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages. MS. MYERS: Correct. Q The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package. That is not a very difficult computation. MS. MYERS: It is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being considered. It depends on how the package is structured. The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made. Q And when the President has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing -- MS. MYERS: Correct. Q they have never once said to him, these are your funding options, including the VAT? He has never heard the word VAT in his -- MS. MYERS: I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular briefings. Q Well, you have. MS. MYERS: I have not, other than to say that he's not considered the VAT. And I think that is a true statement. Q No, but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option. MS. MYERS: Correct. Q That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it. MS. MYERS: I'm not going to get into the details of what's discussed. I think that statement stands for itself. Q specific, Dee Dee. When you say he hasn't looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general? Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages are, the whole thing. It sounds like -- MS. MYERS: But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure. And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan. But clearly, it's something that he's thought about in the broad context. I mean, that was clear in Chilicothe. What I'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet. It's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options, and that no decisions have been made. And I'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed. Q It's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place. You say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him. MS. MYERS: That is correct. Q Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal? MS. MYERS: No decisions have been made. We have nothing to add to what's already been said. Q Let me follow up here. Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive? MS. MYERS: I'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if. Q But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said you'd exclude food and energy -- MS. MYERS: I'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been made. Q Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups? MS. MYERS: I don't know specifically what -- Q Could you check for us, because that's a real important credibility question? MS. MYERS: Sure. Q Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money. Were you all kept in the dark? Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option? MS. MYERS: I think we've said all that we have to say. It is something the working groups are looking at. The President has not made a decision about it yet. And beyond that, I have nothing to add. Q Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily. What we're asking is, if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us. MS. MYERS: I don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever. Q Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out -- MS. MYERS: We're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody. I've said what I have to say about this issue. Q All we were trying to find out -- MS. MYERS: I understand what you're trying to find out and I've given you the answers, Helen. Q We're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again. That's the -- MS. MYERS: The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that. Q Yes, but it wasn't an option before. How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table? MS. MYERS: It is something that they're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision on. Q Yes, but he took it off the table in February. MS. MYERS: Working groups are considering it. They'll present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision. Q Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table? MS. MYERS: It's clearly on the table. Q Yes, but he took it off the table. Did he change his mind? MS. MYERS: It's back on the table, Bill. Q Did he change his mind? MS. MYERS: He said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about it. He obviously knows that it's on the table. It's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you know. Q So he must have changed his mind, right? MS. MYERS: At some point it will be looked at. I mean, -- Q Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the President's. MS. MYERS: The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options; they've done that. Q Are you going to put out his income tax? MS. MYERS: Yes, there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon. His return will be available. Q Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it? MS. MYERS: No, nothing's planned. I think someone will be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you through the questions. Q We're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms. MS. MYERS: I've seen those briefings. (Laughter.) Q Could we have one? MS. MYERS: No, I don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it. Q Did they file a joint form? MS. MYERS: Yes. Q When did he file it? MS. MYERS: I believe it's being filed today. Q Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa? MS. MYERS: No, there will be a readout after the meeting. Q No backgrounder today? MS. MYERS: No backgrounder today. Q This is complicated stuff. We need help. (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day, it's too confusing. (Laughter.) Q Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in Bosnia. They've both said that, A, they never ruled it out, and B, it might be necessary now. Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach? MS. MYERS: There's been no change in our policy towards Bosnia. We have always said that we'd consider -- Q But does that impact upon your decision? Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you? MS. MYERS: They're people whose opinions carry weight certainly. I mean, the President supports the process that they've initiated. But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, although we're considering a number of options right now. If the Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, which we've been saying regularly. Q One follow-up question then? We cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration. Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs? Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table? MS. MYERS: We're continuing to put pressure on them every day. Q Which doesn't work so -- MS. MYERS: Well, we think it is having some effect. We're going to continue to tighten sanctions. As you know, we support the omnibus resolution. We expect that to come to a vote on the 26th. Q You say it's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation? MS. MYERS: I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that. Q There's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Bosnia. Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no. MS. MYERS: I think that they've had effect in Serbia and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia. And again, I'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if you'd like. Q We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in Bosnia. We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting. Can you provide something along those lines? MS. MYERS: I will see what I can get you. Q On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from? MS. MYERS: We'll have to work with Congress on the details of that package. Q So that would be new money that you would hope to get? MS. MYERS: Yes, that's new money, in addition to the $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver. So I assume that you all have seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Christopher. Q Isn't there a concern, though, about offering something which you have to get in Congress? I mean, that was the concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that. MS. MYERS: The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately, which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal '93 budget. What we're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we announced in Vancouver. This clearly will require congressional approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to work with Congress to make that happen. Q To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress? MS. MYERS: The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward. Q Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress? MS. MYERS: It was created in consultation with Congress. Q In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal? A direction? MS. MYERS: Yes, the President will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs package. They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do. Q Who are they? MS. MYERS: It's members or leadership from three organizations: NAPO, which is the National Association of Police Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union of Police Associations. Q Will the FBI chief be there? MS. MYERS: The FBI chief? No. Q Or any other federal law enforcement officials? MS. MYERS: No, it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization leaders. Q Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament? MS. MYERS: No. The Nunn-Lugar money is separate. Q So this would be the $700 million that's in the budget already, plus another $1.1 billion? MS. MYERS: I believe all of this is on top of the $700 million already in the budget. Q Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal '94 -- MS. MYERS: We'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for. Q This $1.8 billion on top of -- MS. MYERS: On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier. Q And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole? MS. MYERS: Correct. Q Is there a briefing on Miyazawa? MS. MYERS: There will be a readout after the meeting with Miyazawa. Tomorrow. Q Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce. There are -- the town hall meeting the other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce? MS. MYERS: That's an interesting charge. (Laughter.) After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of being too close. I think that's interesting. But no, we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives. Q What's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat? MS. MYERS: It's on his calendar. I think he'll almost certainly go. Q All three days? MS. MYERS: We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there yet. Q Is it open to coverage? MS. MYERS: No, I believe the whole thing is closed. Q Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th? MS. MYERS: We're still looking at that. We haven't made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or what -- Q Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders? MS. MYERS: Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it out. Q What about an AIDS czar? MS. MYERS: It's coming. Q Anything on the weekend? Q There's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march. MS. MYERS: No, I think this is something he's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic retreat. Q The weekend? MS. MYERS: Weekend? Don't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on Saturday. Q Any travel plans? MS. MYERS: If it changes -- none right now. Q He's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package? MS. MYERS: No specific plans right now. Q What about mid-week? Anything likely? MS. MYERS: It's possible. Yes, I think it's likely that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend. Q Has he called Thurmond about his daughter? MS. MYERS: I don't know. I'll check. Q Going to name a drug czar this weekend? MS. MYERS: This weekend? I don't believe so. Q And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package? MS.

Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 227 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15, 1993 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS The Rose Garden 2:52 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the American people, their jobs and their economic future. The federal budget plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country. Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago. It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. All of these members of Congress know it's time to get the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity. Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill. When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake. The issue is not politics, it's people. Sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and can't find them. These men and women don't care about who's up or down in Washington. They care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck. They're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward. I am prepared to do that. And I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan. I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs. Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package. Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the American people. But even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime. So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession. Together, with a matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in communities all across our nation. At a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments America can make. And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind. I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs. Make no mistake about it: I will fight for these priorities as hard as I ever have. I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change. I want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers. They came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package. And I want them to be free to talk about that. They came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future. I say what I say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities. I have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect. It reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time. These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do. I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years. This makes a good downpayment on that. This keeps in mind the core of the jobs package. And this will help us to move forward. So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the jobs bill, let's work together. I can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets. I do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people. I have done my part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours. I want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished Attorney General. * * * * * * * * * * * * Q Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional dialogue? THE PRESIDENT: Not at all. I think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other. First of all, I made absolutely no decision on that. You should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy. But I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax. Q Do you personally believe that the American public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care? I mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to speculate on that. I will say this: The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost. I mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system. The real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security. I have no idea. The polls say that, but I don't know. All I know is the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an affordable health care system. But I don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have. People want a job first and foremost. They want that more than anything else. Q Now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable? I assume summer jobs is one. THE PRESIDENT: I want the summer jobs; I want the highway program and I want the police program. I still intend -- let me say this: I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill, which did not pass the Congress last year. This is a supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way. But I think we need to do that. I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with AIDS. And there are several other things that I think should be done. We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the safety of the public depends on that. There are a number of other things that I don't -- I don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them. And Senator Dole called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call him back. I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we discussed this. And I basically asked them to talk today, and said that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord. So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been already, and let's see if they can talk it out. Q When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 million, that you want that as part of the package? THE PRESIDENT: I did -- I told Senator -- I left word for Senator Mitchell last night about it. When I talked to Senator Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it. But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to address. And this is certainly consistent with that. Thank you. END3:12 P.M. EDT

Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are those who live in the cities where the train stops. Who wants to drive to the train station from X (Lubbock for example)? It's probably farther to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport. I really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three cities will benefit from.

Ipser, Jr., 1993 > Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list 10. It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the military. Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them. 9. Let me explain something to you. Environmental policy and industrial policy MUST go hand in hand. Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years. Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We must have active government support of the key industries such as, telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental tech. Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries that are better left to other nations. This will make us richer, help produce new jobs, and help the environment. To give credit where credit is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) tonite. In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion. The planet on which we live should be our utmost priority! 8. It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work, to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems that need to be solved. Granted, some things can probably be done more efficiently for less money, and should be. But some things are going to cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about taxes all the time. You want to live in my country, you pay your fair share! 7. I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes. If you're willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes! 6. Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch! 5. Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are entitled to). If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then I guess we've found something better than capitalism! There is nothing sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die. 4. Make love, not War! 3. Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist at the same time. To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force them into some sort of tradition role is even worse. Women certainly have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of the past few centuries seem like reform bills. I look forward to it. 2. See number 10. 1. HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!! -Amar Chaudhary Peace, Land, at Matzoh! "AC in DC in 2008!"

Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2: Male sex survey: Gay activity low A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough examination of American men's sexual practices published since the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2 percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual. The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report. The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population. It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. -- Clayton E.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993. P. A1. EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people. Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American, right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations. Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws. Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League. Also on the list were Mills College, the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper. People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who is based in South Africa. Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies. They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government. In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant. The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in San Francisco. Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment, his office said. Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California. Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League. The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws. League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes. But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches, San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant. David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said the organization has not violated the law. "There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said. "Our record speaks for itself." The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations." Lehrer, according to the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L. Patterson. An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti-Defamation League. Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police. He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance. "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said. "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files. It's not a threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under, say, 'Pinko.'" In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case. A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses, vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license photographs. Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government, receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show. The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation. The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written," but little else about the file is accurate. The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal information. Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash of target groups. Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag." He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast, exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network. The Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and investigators. Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board. The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los Angeles but not invited to participate. Investigators suspect that some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may have come from Los Angeles police officers. From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993. P. A23. ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer. SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups. But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax violations and conspiracy. Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations, which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum. Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures. Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file. In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H. Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years." Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police, journalists, academics, government officials and the public. It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally, he said. "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information," Foxman said. The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'" Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman. "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator. Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment. Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall. A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants, produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial transactions, Smith said. Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said. "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us," the district attorney said. -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it! arens@isi.edu js

EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Good afternoon. Q Could we do this on the lawn? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That would be nice. Let's go out to the cherry blossoms. We'll do like the President. Q Is the stimulus package dead? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not. Q Can you tell us more about the Dole talks? You said it was a good visit, but no compromise. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night. I think that as we said before, there were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well. As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package. They did not speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the President was out. Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package. They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon. At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator was up in New Hampshire. And although there were no specific compromises made on either side, they did say that they would continue to have some discussions. And that's where we are. Q Well, who is giving in? Where is it standing --are both making concessions? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know that it's at that phase. No compromise has been made. As the President has said consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package. He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to make those adjustments. Q On the subject of a VAT -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, boy. Q Can we stay on this for one more minute? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. Q We have a problem with the five minutes -- Q I know no decisions have been made, but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go down that road. No decisions have been made. As the President said this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at. The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been made. Q To follow, have they done that directly through him? Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge, although there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT. But the President has not made a decision. Q At the meetings that he's had with his own task force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think that that has been presented for a decision, no. Q Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an option? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, there are a lot of levels of briefing. I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on. Q You're not saying he didn't know it was being considered, though, are you? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, he said it's being considered. Q He knew that. Q But has he discussed that with his advisers? That's what I'm asking. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has said it's being considered. I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT. It is something the working groups are looking at. I don't even know that it's -- Q But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at this stage? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, he is not. I think we're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here. What is considered -- Q Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed it. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That is true. That is what I just repeated. Q George, is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out the way it did, that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think so. I mean, it is now public knowledge that this is being considered. Q Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it come out not from you people, but -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, wait a second. It came out from the administration. What are you talking about? Q What I'm saying is, though, that the President said he would let us know. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. Q You people then said -- you said, I believe, that it's not going to be on the program. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: On March 25th. Q On March 25th. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Circumstances change. Q Well, I understand. But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Rooting around -- I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article. But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I mean, that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right here, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying." Q What about his remark that if it were being considered, he'd tell us about it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the administration's concerned, and he'd let you know. Q And did he? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Absolutely. What did he say this morning? Q It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It didn't have to be dragged out of me. We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered. That is his administration. That is his administration policy. Q Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they orchestrated leaks? I mean, what was the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They were asked questions, they answered the questions. Q You're saying here that it didn't have to be dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. I was very clear. Painfully clear. Q Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, it was just this issue is being considered. They were asked if it was being considered; they answered that it was being considered. Q George, The New York Times -- Q Why do it yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They were asked. Q The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, but which turned out to be totally false. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if it was totally false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they say that. Q The question is, is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data? And what's he doing about it, if so? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The chief economist has said that a mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the matter. Q Isn't that the same information that goes to the President? Q If I could go back to the stimulus package -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: There's two separate pieces of information. I think that's where the confusion was. Q When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I read the article this morning. Q And as far as you know, is the President aware of it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think so. Q And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. Not to my knowledge. Q Did you ever hear about it before this morning? Anything? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn't. Q Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose? For his speeches, for his arguments? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well again, I'm not sure. Both statements are true. What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading. They said it was a mistake. They said they wouldn't do it again. Q Did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Whenever fewer people are out of work, we're gratified. But that doesn't take away from the need to get this jobs package going. Q If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute. You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment. Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think at this point there's no changes in the schedule at all. I don't know that they discussed the timing like that. Q Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I believe that we're going to pass a jobs package. The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen. I don't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time. I don't know what's going to happen until we have a vote. But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done. Q Has there been any indication that this situation has changed? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to continue to work on it. We'll know when the votes are taken. Q George, last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept. This week you're talking to him. Is that because you've realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package. Q He initiated the conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all. You say he's making -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know that that's exactly what he said. I think he said he didn't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, and the President doesn't want to compromise. And the President doesn't want to compromise. But if he has to make adjustments to get it through, he will. Q Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's possible. Q Today? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure exactly when that will happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed. Q As we understood his conversations with Dole, the first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase is. Did he offer him some details or some adjustments? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it's a question of how detailed. I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon. I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole. And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific compromises at this date. When we have something we'll let you know. And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way. Q What are the follow-up discussions if not the President and Dole? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole. Q Is that a threat? (Laughter.) Q Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the President, I can go as high as this? Did they talk numbers? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think it was a negotiation in that respect. It was more of a discussion about their positions. Q Did they discuss actual numbers? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages. I think they talked about the programs they cared about. I don't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars. Q Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, of course not. Q Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking? Was that in any way organized by -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge, no. Q And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think he's talked to them, no. Q George, is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots? And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves having to pay for the have-nots? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his budget, should go up. And I think for the second half of your question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday. Q George, on the subject of accuracy in information, you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee. Apparently that is not true. It's actually waste water money. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's waste water money for Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. Q But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it's waste water money, right? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It would affect the water treatment overall. Q But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now. Would you agree that's not the case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure of the specifics. I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin. Q A leftover question from this morning, which was, when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure exactly when. I just don't know. I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago. Q So sometime since March 25th? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's right. I don't know the exact date. Q George, the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax. Apparently, the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax. So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already proposed? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we've said all we have to say about the VAT at this point. I mean, there's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all. The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. Q But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the income tax, for instance? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: There have been no discussions on that. Q In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day. Do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress? Would it have a chance? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I have no idea. Q Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it. It's not in consideration now. Q You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, what the President referred to this morning. These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered. Q Those are the circumstances that have changed? That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's what he said. Q Is that true? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not going to get into the deliberations. Q But, George -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. What the consideration is, as the President said, groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider. The working groups are looking at it. Q Is that the only thing that's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it? Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the groups -- as you know, the health care task force has met with dozens of groups. Q But this is the President's knowledge that these groups had come forward. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups. Obviously, there have also been published positions in the newspapers. Q Have certain groups briefed him on the group's presentations to them? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they've briefed him -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been. I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups. Q What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know, it's just they've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care. Q The President wasn't aware of those longstanding positions? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He may have been at some level. Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax. Q What we're trying to figure out here -- you're telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February and now -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President's attitude hasn't necessarily changed. I mean, he has not made a decision. Q I know, but the President said that it was off the table. So did you. And you're saying that the only thing that's changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also describing them as longstanding positions. I don't see the change. If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been made to the President -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, they've made the presentations to the health care task force. Q There's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue. Q Well, he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He did say that. I don't know that he said anything to refute that. Q But, in fact, has the task force discovered that there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I don't think that the task force ever suggested that there would. Q George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I can't comment on a hypothetical situation. Q But does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax. When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the implications then. Q Which specific groups can you cite -- business, labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't have the specific. I just don't have that. Q George, can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking at a wide variety of options. I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration. But I'm not going to comment -- Q What's the scope -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not going to comment on them, no. Q What's the scope of the need? How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's what the health care task force is looking at. Q Since there's not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit, two questions: One, generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Vancouver note? Q Does no mean yes. Q Yes and no. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I don't know. I saw the Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question. The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President. There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S. that we want to do something about. Q Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade. Are you going to oblige? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly. I don't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister's comments. Q that we need specific export targets, specific numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with Miyazawa? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues. I don't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting. Q Why? Q That's the crux of the issue, right? Whether or not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around. I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done. Q But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think, first, the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it. Q How about the Russian aid package? There seems to be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, we're going to continue to work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform. And I think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages. Q Do you think the Japanese need to do more? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can. Q Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on the Bosnia policy. And he said, "It's a rather emotional response." MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Over an emotional issue. Q Right -- to an emotional problem. Does the White House condone that kind of remark? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that Secretary Christopher's remarks speaks for itself. The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find answers for. Q But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- specific term? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, it speaks for itself. Q In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: For example? Q To take stronger action, to take military action -- air strikes, anything that can be done? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions. He is also -- as you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo. He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time. Q What is your response to the critics who would say that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They're wrong. We're pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. We're pressing hard for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the arms embargo. Q You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that. Now, Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable. Does that change your thinking? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Clearly, we're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say. But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo. Q A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning. She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia. Are you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think that's what she said. Q That's exactly what she said. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think that's true. But what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia. Obviously, if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have an effect over time. I do not know day by day, minute by minute, what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been. But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade. We are having an effect on the Serbs there. What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't know. But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much. Q Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be released? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think there's a joint tax return. And it will be probably later today. Q Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think there's any proposal for that at this time, not that I know of. Q It's something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I have not seen any -- I don't think it's anything that's on his plate right now. Q Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know about on this issue. I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities. Q Do you know if that's scheduled -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's probably going to be tomorrow. Q Probably going to be tomorrow? (Laughter.) Q It's a good thing you asked. Q Who's probably going to be there? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. Q How long -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. That's all I know. Q Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know what time it is. I don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow. Q Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind. Is that going to happen, do you know? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they've asked, but I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will. If it's not exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like that. Q Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I don't know the specific timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under discussion and something we've been working on. Q Campaign finance reform? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're working on it. Q Do you think it will be next week? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. Q The biodiversity treaty is something you're working on? I missed the question. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, something we're working on. He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working on. Q Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't. Q Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday, as he did last year. Q Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: On what? Q On the gays. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: When we went through the President's schedule for the day, certainly. Q? George, what day is the publisher's speech? Is that Sunday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it's a Sunday. Q And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, I'm not sure. I don't know how long the Senate thing goes. It might go overnight. I just don't know. Q You would have made the gay meeting public, right? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm certain if we had the meeting -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you about it. Q I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn't say it was going to be in the Oval Office. (Laughter.) But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's not, but I didn't say that it was. (Laughter.) Q at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done that. So I just wanted to make sure -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the President wouldn't do anything like that. Q Certainly not. Q What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They had a very good discussion for about half an hour today. He wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs. He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document. The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards Vietnam. He'll be looking at Vietnam's response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives. And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the document. Q Vietnam says it's a fake. What is the DOD analysis at this stage? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's not completed yet, and it's also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Vietnamese. Q A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to time. Do people -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We don't have any final determination. We're going to wait for the complete review; when we have it, we'll make a judgment. Q I know you don't have any final determination, but given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that that's a likely possibility? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just don't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete. Q George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think so, but I'm not positive. Yes, I expect, yes. Q Was Toon in with Vessey? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q He was in on the meeting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q What was the question? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, and the answer is yes. Q Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Well, I do have a response. I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the press. I would point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also -- Q How many questions? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 occasions. Q How many were while he was jogging? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, no, that's actually a very good question, Andrea. And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false. He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the -- Q Oval Office press conference -- when was that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's answered questions in the -- East Room. He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the Roosevelt Room. And this is just to the White House, Washington Press Corps. In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local television anchors. He's met with the editorial board of The Portland Oregonian. He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and Connecticut -- Q Can you address the question of the attitude? The article implies that he doesn't -- Q Why doesn't he like us? (Laughter.) Q Did you really get blamed for that Post story? Q The story is that you -- are you held responsible for it. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think I'm going to comment about this. Q Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and myself. Q Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: What? Q The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, yes. Q That is an authentic letter? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Since the President first talked about the VAT in February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing. Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I just can't comment on a proposal he hasn't made. Q George, does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights. Q The military issue? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm certain it will come up. Q Is he using this event to name the AIDS -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think so. Q George, what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's had briefing memos. He's had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the Trade Representative and others. Q report yet? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if he has the report referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him today. Q He was? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Does he intend to use any of these instances that -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I don't know that the report's been presented. But obviously, the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred. Q In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was that there's a real schism here -- a hostility. Do you think he feels that way? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. As I said on the record in the article, I think the President likes reporters. Again, I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading. The thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent history. Q Can we come up to your office? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: If you're invited. THE PRESS: Thank you. END 1:34 P.M. EDT #57-04/15 
From: kennejs@a.cs.okstate.edu (KENNEDY JAMES SCOT) Subject: Drug Use Up At Younger Age Organization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, Stillwater Keywords: youths drugs LSD inhalants Lines: 62 The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up At Younger Age" by Mike Snider, p. 1A). Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders - usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue and air fresheners, says a new survey. The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants. "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services. But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long decline. The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the following in the 30 days before they were polled: * 8th-graders - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%; cocaine 0.7%. * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%; cocaine 0.7%. * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%; cocaine 1.3%. Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants declined over the year before. Not so with LSD. * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24% over 1991. * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6% tried it in the last year. Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part of an overall illness prevention plan. The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders disapprove of them. "It's scary," Shalala says. "Dealers are focusing on younger, more vulnerable kids."

From: kennejs@a.cs.okstate.edu (KENNEDY JAMES SCOT) Subject: We're winning the war on drugs. Not! Organization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, Stillwater Keywords: drugs DEA WOD legalization Lines: 140 The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the "war on drugs". I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise. If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now. The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much. If anything, substance abuse is on the rise. I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem. The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59). Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed. "Perhaps because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. "The fact is, they're losing the battle." In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner says it is still falling. Bonner also offers a reminder that studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down. The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public. Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*. Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" is being lost. Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective. For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug. Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs. This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular. The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education). Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime. Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts. IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers: make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them. As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to. This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on. I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out. They are as follows: * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used. Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in. * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels. Part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement. * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of 18). Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent. Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony. * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible. This agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now. I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup. Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD. Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :) BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

From: kennejs@a.cs.okstate.edu (KENNEDY JAMES SCOT) Subject: Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eighth-graders Organization: Oklahoma State University, Computer Science, Stillwater Keywords: youths drugs LSD inhalants Lines: 87 The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by Mike Snider, p. 6D). A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is being won. But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students nationwide. Possible reason for the increase: more experimentation. Why? If drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston, one of the survey authors. Each new wave of youths "must be given the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs," Johnston says. This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95). But that's not the issue, she says. The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now. Aggravating the problem: baby boomer parents - who experimented with drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to their children. "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to their underage kids and friends, Shiff says. For a recent graduation, Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where no booze or drugs were allowed. "We need to fulfill that parental role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says. Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale, Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line. Linkous, a member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be experimentation" with drugs. A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says. But "some don't want to give kids the facts. They think it will give them ideas; it's the same with birth control. I think you should give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes, pamphlets and speakers, she says. Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores, Fla. "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs). I think kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds (about using drugs)," he says. Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only one commercial has gotten it right, he says. The commercial opens with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having no prom date. Then they take a hit off a joint. "That hits home because it's not attractive," he says. "You can't be doing drugs if you want somebody to like you." Adolescents' choices Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month: Estimated, per 100 students 1991 1992 Pct. chg.

Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks real strongly of double jeopardy. A civil case for damages is fine since that is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first. I think a bad precedent has already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would make it worse. Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three marines and that's how it should stand.

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer. In addition, it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the time. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions. Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars. Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up. So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life. Here's what I see libertarianism offering you: Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you. You can use it to buy a car. If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you. You can use your money to fix up that car. Since it is your car, you can sell that car. Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you. It matters not if someone thinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars. They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money. My money is truly mine; it belongs to me. I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car. Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying. That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it. But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other. This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense. A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition. Thanks awfully, Patrick

OK. I stand corrected. I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs (i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still stands? Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic: Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress? The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent each State equally.

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied, caused, starvation, hunger, and death. Few people know that the Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a common food store. Many people know the hardships they suffered the first few winters because of it. After arriving, the Pilgrims made all property common. They all shared in the work and the resulting crops went into a common store. After much debate the new Governor Bradford privitized the land; assigning plots to each family. According to Perry D. Westbrook: "The change was immediately justified by the increased industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted." Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism. He wrote: "The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God. For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort." Bradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basic selfishness in all men. He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them." In other words, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to be the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state." Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made. Private property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings starvation, poverty and discontent. -- Paul Schmidt: Advocates for Self-Government, Davy Crockett Chapter President 706 Judith Drive, Johnson City, TN 37604, (615)283-0084, uunet!tijc02!pjs269 "Freedom seems to have unleashed the creative energies of the people -- and leads to ever higher levels of income and social progress." -- U.N. report

As I've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers, barbers, etc. One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end. Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention. (As some/many libertarians would argue.) On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile. The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment. It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits. This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, to say the least. I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through "statist" approaches. With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians. jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

It would seem more logical to say that since the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity larger as well. In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it. Men are men and they all like sex. I am a gay male. I have had sex three times in my life, all with the same man. Before that, I was a virgin. So... whose promiscuous? Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals. Just because someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do. Look at the world....

The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate. If implemented, it would encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy. Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate. Will Lega Nord be one of these? Who knows. (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post) Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change. Italians are tired of having crappy government. Porn stars, Pavarotti's and Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead. A good two-party system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government. It's about time.

Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot of people who condemn it). As a result, the gay population is not encouraged to develop "non-promiscuous" relationships. In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships. It is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays are immoral. "My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?" Just some thoughts. Flame away. :) Dan

Nationwide, the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50%, but it is reportedly as low as 10% in some inner-city neighborhoods. I bet more than 10% kids living in such neighborhoods are already covered by Medicaid.

The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class. Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not. In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.

(Don't think I'm going to say, "spend it to educate people", because I know plenty of educated dopers). Actually, spend it on things like drug treatment programs. I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his "recommended" dosage, and try to ween him off from it, or cut the amount down to levels where it is "acceptable". Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.) However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly. Plus, I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD. The 60 Minute Report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin. Ryan

The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its stupidity. The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their existence.

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like. There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft. Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it. (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.) However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis. In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues. Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office. They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office. You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis. Not so with economic issues. Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers. Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis. There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise. But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient" manner; I call it political market failure. Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to swallow the "whole libertarian agenda." Roger Collins

It works for any situation. If you believe the market is going up, don't sell. If believe it's not, sell. But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't you? So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out? There isn't any. Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is "proof" of that proposition, but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing capital gains revenues wouldn't account for a lot of that increase. 1986 was the height of the housing boom, remember.

Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented here either. Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949. This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%. Similarly the increase in cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%. This doesn't even take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here. This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded, but it does mean that USA Today has (not surprisingly) provided us with virtually no information.

As one of the "Clintonites" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's "dishonesty." (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.) There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal. Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed. (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress. It didn't work.) The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list. If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level. In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects. The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage. (Yup, there are places where that is true.) The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city. The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities. If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds. And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue. A final point. One may or may not like community block grants. It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new. Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than "Washington bureaucrats." Is it clear now? Or is this all too complicated to understand? jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Even with heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and information about sexuality and relationships. It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and immoral. The concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalism and fear- these fears cover a wide range, but mostly jealousy and lack of trust seem to be cornerstones of modern day American relationships. We also set on top of this the concepts of Madison Avenue attractiveness and standards and put the pressure on to measure up.

I have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'. I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys', they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the studies on both sides- subject and researcher. Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked? Would you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal rate (this applies to heterosexual men). In fact, as one gay man and one straight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that's the thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type of response. It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional and mental price tag. I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' conquest. They just have to look good to one another, at least in their eyes. But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.

There's this minor thing called "interest of finality/repose". What it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again because the losing side "discovers" some "new" evidence. I don't know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started. Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him. BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial "based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence" if made within 2 years of the verdict. (Emphasis mine.)

Too bad it's so demonstrably false. Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a nice history on drug criminalization.

He's setting himself up to be in hot water. Indeed. Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose. Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return. Mr. Newman took him up on it. Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning. Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000. Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won. So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward. However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code. --Tim Smith

What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined. If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing. If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases. You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts. Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail. Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful. Bush/congress was unbelievable. As a really rigorous aside to this thread..... During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an "economist" who gave an hour or so presentation. His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant. He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" economic activities. People cause economic activity. More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles. He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century. It will be neat to see how accurate he is. Paul Collacchi

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care. >Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price >machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges. Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis. Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred. > >> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but >> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) > >Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an >array of products at prices below cost? Are not grocery stores >embedded in a relatively free market? Can you spell "loss leader?" I knew you could. Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it. In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained. But the evidence does not support this contention. Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits. Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have. There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc. Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur. (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.) The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers. Claims that "government bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account. jsh > >=Mark -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM "One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Teel: Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a while now. Humbug. Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations. Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness). This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax). Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material "concrete proof". There has been no refutation to date. Have the nay-sayers finally given up as defeated? Sure would like to hear their reasons for disbelief at this point. Refutation?? Refutation of what? You haven't made a case yet. You've posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you. Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever. And the cases you've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court. Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary? What, you say? No such case exists? Hmmm, I wonder why not; why haven't you? Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the opposition has forfeited the field? With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want. I just hope, for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions. For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing. Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo? Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway? Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"? When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington, D.C., where they belong? Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like. If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207). Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this garbage. If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head. Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to care too much about US tax law. I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend- ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign tax credit). -- Rich Wales <richw@mks.com> // Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

He/she cannot make laws. If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one. So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted. For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies: the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress. We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement). So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions. >John Eaton >!hp-vcd!johne

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint. What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions. Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable. Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome. The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal. To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook "Any town having more churches than bars has a serious social problem." ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's) --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex (due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the children from abuse by members of the *same* sex. If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms. Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long* stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the future. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Rick Roy Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com America Online: QED Disclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.

This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North. Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat. Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states. # Craig A.

Double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge. However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating Mr. King's civil rights. AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states, it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence.

In practice, communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards. The mass butchery of "kulaks" in the USSR is a good instance of this. A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee. I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba. Would they have revolted and killed him off, or been killed? Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in, load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of obedience, prison, or flight. This would be a bad science-fiction novel, if the East Germans hadn't actually done it. The last person to die crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back. Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to socialists in Chile.

The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B" word, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word - LOSER !! That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain. Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet. The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then (wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win. No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer (We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a few "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had it so good. In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentler type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of discourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winning business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no suggestion of losing. But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our "white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days. Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ? What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott declaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser." And so on. The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some "equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority. Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition). In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a "neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit the pot. Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !!

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes. So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present. There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories. Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks. In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988). Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes. Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences, except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!! -- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies, we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of 1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically. When standards of living, population densities, and industrial structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group of Seven nations. Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product, even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall U.S. economy. Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies. Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not reduce demand. Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance, gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state at the expense of the individual.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books, Inc. ----------------------------------------------------------------- This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington, DC 20006. Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter. Today is April 30, 1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74. It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic. On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island. In reality, it's far more than that. The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation. During this month of April 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific. Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides. But as I say these words, the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface. Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun. At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area. To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time. Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are overextended. Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina. As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be. There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat. That reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month. Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet. Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses. To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained. In short, my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap. The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past. For weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an "armada" (quote). The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description. The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada. The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I. The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake. Drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle. The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach. From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada. When it was all over, barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port. Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world. It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire. Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle. Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation. Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish. Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene. The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America. The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy. My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are: Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR. Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot. For a century and a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain. During that entire time, British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina. There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them. The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep. In short, the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place. We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina. The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep. Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it. Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed. Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force. The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70. Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina. Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this fight really all about? The most popular answer suggested in the major media is "oil." Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years. In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island. South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise. South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow. Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island. In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands. In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists. In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island. For that and other historical reasons, Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina, not Britain. But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island. It has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or Spain. The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view. Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms. They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long. By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island was retaken by Britain. So the question is: Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all? My friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic. South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret. It's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly. The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new. What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington. For the past two months I've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them. The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982!! It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now. What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war. The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis. They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of the "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month. That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE. As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world. The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war. Having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in Government war bunkers! When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries. They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open. They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months. The Rockefeller cartel and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan. Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago. It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks. Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers. In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination. It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually. Without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple. By deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world. When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s. Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great Britain, France, Red China, and India. By contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between. In other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war. In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war. But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread. It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In the northern half of our planet, cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air. A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places. The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers. A quick look at the globe of the world shows why. The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II. As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war. He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources. Then there is the African continent. There, too, Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa, especially south of the equator. All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No. 36. Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand. Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the Rockefellers. The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war. By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war. Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces. In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth. In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass. For example, revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon. The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy. A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific. Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards. New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden. To hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space. On top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation. Finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out. The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself. During a so-called banking trip to Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port. The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water. The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors. Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships. The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted. A survey of candidate sites was then initiated. The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere. Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator. Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible. Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically. At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected. In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was selected. This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme importance in the coming war. In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together. One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water's edge. The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island, which is off the tip of South Island. The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem. The New Zealand location met all the requirements. Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain. The location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack. They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific. In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island. It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic. The tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast. The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain took no chances. In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists. Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction. The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged. Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up. When sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention. The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea. Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage. The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task. From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme. He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. All through the 60's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America's visible military power. This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards. What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards. Where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island! The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States. As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time. That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first. This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques. The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines. They are all nuclear powered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them. A secret twin was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent. All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way! The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels. Even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference. Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield. This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity. A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment! The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field. After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth. It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination. The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military. Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war. These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the "Falklands crisis." Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described "PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE. An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington. It's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia. Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers. Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies. Activating Phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets. With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world. The United States as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory. Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track. They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982! Time is fast running out. The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race. They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks. One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways. In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians. The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition. It is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" now dominating the headlines. It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance. They have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America. The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67. A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented. The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly. No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer. The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month. It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled. By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them. The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack. It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked. Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable. Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question. There was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world. Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent. But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter. In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles' heel. The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible. The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands. As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades. Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there. The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked. The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do. As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards. They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands. This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy. And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves. With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan. On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack plan. A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island. Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell. While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site. The British, always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as expected. The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22 Marines ashore. They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag. The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil. From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain. That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy. It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot. During late March, Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands. "Nothing new", thought the British high command. Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times. It was believed that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected. After many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands. All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island. The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists. That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan. Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base. Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense. By late that evening, April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place. The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible. The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside. It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base. Once the hole was made, the next step was obvious. The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole. The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas. The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described, my friends. The Thatcher government, like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik controlled. That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too" any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia. Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble. Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic. Haste was the order of the day. The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock. The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about April 24. If help did not reach South Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed. The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances. Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle. They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons. To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide. On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister. He was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations. That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "Red Alert." As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea. Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier. On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York. He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials. He got them! For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on. That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island. If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely. The official stories about "slow movement" of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle. If need be, the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island, then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule. In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved. It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks. That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed. But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan. Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was announced officially. Shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble. Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island. The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation. In moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced. Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes. It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly. So far as is known, there were no survivors. This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results, both important: First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada. The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time. Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown. The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer. All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island. The drilling continued. The other result of the sinking was equally important. Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action. It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble. During the dead of night, early April 15, the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand. They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast of New Zealand. Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack. These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters. The Antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America. The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for. The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand! The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events. On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port. The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires. Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a General, dealing with Generals. Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have revealed in the past. He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment. Four days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington. As he boarded his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base. The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base. Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend. The British fleet was still out of range. The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb. When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating. The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base. Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them. Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders. From a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed. Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed. The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines. The "subs" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact. More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world. The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time. The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym. Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public. But not Haig. Haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder. The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success. The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled. By working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere. Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over. What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath. That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands. They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war. At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain. As soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the Falklands. Britain has no choice but to fight. She has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign. On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze movement." There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war. In recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue. Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war. We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously. We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time. If you believe that, my friends, I give up. Movements like this never, and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it. What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work. As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place. If it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it. Instead, the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war. The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group. It's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers. The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers. Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day. The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda. That objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT. The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign. Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power. These days the smell of war is in the air. The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense. The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war. A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill. It will have teeth! As presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland. The working name, though this may be changed, is the "World Nonproliferation Council." The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all. LAST MINUTE SUMMARY Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary. In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis. The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere. These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable. The attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen. One result, though, is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap. Britain's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand. My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks. They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear. If we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope. As the Scripture tells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind." We must learn to wage peace. As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God." Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter. Thank you, and may God bless each and every one of you.

Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death....

Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 220 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary (Vancouver, British Columbia) _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 4, 1993 PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT WITH RUSSIAN PRESS Canada Place Vancouver, British Columbia 2:46 P.M. PDT Q I had two questions for both Presidents, so you could probably answer for Boris, too. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I'll give you my answer, then I'll give you Yeltsin's answer. (Laughter.) Q The first is that this is the meeting of the Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government. But you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses. So the question is how the Russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever? What are the priorities, because there are several association of Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment? This is the first. And second, to you. We know that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid. Like Newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports Yeltsin. How are you going to sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not very enthusiastic? Thank you. Q I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into Russian? No, just the answers. Just the answers. Okay. THE PRESIDENT: The answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing. For example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application. The privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises. Then there are some other general funds in the Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have some influence over the distribution of. With regard to your second question, let me say that I would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government giving money to the Russian government. There's opposition to that in Russia. And in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds. That is, this has nothing to do with Russia. If you look at the whole history of America, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular. What I have tried to tell the American people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future. We spent $4 trillion -- trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the Cold War. Now, with a democratic government in Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the Russian side. So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the United States. This is very much in the interest of the United States. The things I announced today, the second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country. Russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals. But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue. That's not what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful investment. Like all investments, there is some risk. But there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the Cold War. Q Mr. President, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us. In the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough. I have two questions. One, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the START II and START I issues. Could you tell us: Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification of START I and the NPT regime? And my second question is, how confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions inherited from the Cold War? PRESIDENT CLINTON: First, we discussed the issue of Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States develop strong relationships with them. We know that one thing that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part. But we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that. I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join the NPT regime is critical. What was the second question? THE PRESIDENT: With regard to Jackson-Vanik and COCOM, I would make two points: First, I have agreed with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies of the Cold War. And we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the Congress. With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to. If the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be much less. With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the COCOM regime. But I think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future. Q Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of Mr. Bush. Could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of Mr. Bush? And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the last part of your speech? THE PRESIDENT: Let me say, first, I do not wish to compare myself with President Bush or anyone else. I can't say what was in his heart about Russia. I can say that since I was a boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of Russia. I have been thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now. I have read major Russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as I could about your history. And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President. But all that time I was away, I was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners. So I have always had a personal feeling about Russia. I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like music very much. One of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony to the Russians. And he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult. That is something I followed very closely when it occurred. These are things that have always had a big impact on my life. And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners. (Applause.) THE PRESS: Thank you. END3:06 P.M. PDT

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02. First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative. > The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and >Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some >"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a >loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian >homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined >day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) >minority. On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did. The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago. My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway. > Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be >popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still >be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I >would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it >is the only way to go. That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner). If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way. >Bill R. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ "At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (Clinton/Gore '92) Subject: CLINTON: Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.5.93 Organization: Project GNU, Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 581 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 5, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS The Briefing Room 10:10 A.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, the President is soon to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards. He'll be throwing out the first pitch. Q It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not Amtrack. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, it's not Amtrack? Well, he's going from Union Station, you're right. Excuse me. Q George, what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with ??? Senate? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, as you know, there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible. We need this investment for summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer. And the President continues to believe his program should be passed. Q Will he compromise, that's the question? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, as you know, the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with. But the President believes his jobs program should go forward. Q George, would the President be willing to accept $8 billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I don't know what is being offered by either side. The Senate discussions are going on right now, let's see what happens today. Q Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per year? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President believes that his program should be passed at this time. Clearly, we're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now. Let's see what happens. Q It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in doing something to create -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, real jobs this summer for the American people. I think there's no question about that. There's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days. Q So, you'll need to compromise to get your package through? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning. Q prepared to compromise -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole. Q Does he feel that he has been defeated in his -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not in the least. In fact, he's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term. Q How? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He passed his budget in record time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by $500 billion over five years. And it's a budget which provides for important investments in our future. Right now we've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House. Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall. Q He can't beat this, can he? Q The fact is they can do that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the Republicans can stop action. There's no question about that. Q What are you going to do about it? Q George, what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that when they say yes they mean no? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting. The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process. I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process. Q Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's not -- I don't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process. Q Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context. It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view. I don't think it's going to be a problem. I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I'm not positive. Q George, was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The discussion was about -- Q The specific comment is what I'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the Japanese say yes they mean no." MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it was a combination. I mean I don't think that's the whole sentence. I think that the specific comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment. Q Was he saying it facetiously first? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was just a casual observation. Q And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up. Has the President sent a message? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, I don't think the President spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I'm not sure exactly how many. Q Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no. It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- reports in Vancouver, and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is on. Q What is our position about the Japanese? That they may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days. He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit. He reiterated the U.S. position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role. And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that. Q After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days, I'm a little confused. What is the U.S. policy? Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have reiterated. We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions. Right now we do not have that compliance. Q throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, Saddam can't stay in office? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. I think that that's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power. But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will continue to demand it. Q And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping support of terrorism. Q That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions. On what logic do you base that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all. He is not respecting the rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution. He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections. He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments. Q Well, when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, right now his power rests on the repression of his people. If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power. Q George, back on the stimulus package, why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock? Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that's in good faith? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the fact that several times in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding. Q George, in regards to that, some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans, and that was it. Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - - MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I'm not sure that it's true that there was only one meeting. I mean, the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package. He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there. We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President's package. We are interested in what they have to say, as well. But we believe that this program is important, and we're going to continue to fight for it. Q your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean, I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity. I mean, there is just no question about that. You only need 40 plus one to keep going. 40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing. Q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer? Q work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President's intiatives? Q But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes? Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes? When you have to go through -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I can't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road. Clearly the President's going to continue to reach out when he can. Q You don't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue to press for that. We will continue to reach out to Republicans, there's not question about that. And we'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation. In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward. Q They're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think they're being -- Q any ideas. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think their amendments are being defeated; I don't know that they're being denied. Q to present them. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's not exactly true. I mean they get the votes -- Q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they're playing. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Unless they get a majority in support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true. Q George, one more on Iraq. Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition? Grooming any new leadership? Q backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for Iraqi compliance. I don't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership. I believe there have been some contacts, at some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups. I don't know about anything recently. Q Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles. Will he consider something like that, or any other kind of intervention there? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, as you know, the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation, including the situation in Los Angeles. I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, Mr. Riley. I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out. And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California. Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances. But we're going to continue to watch it. Q George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management. Does the President have a position on that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson. I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty. He clearly raises serious questions. There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years, but still not enough. But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game. Q Is he going to say anything about it today, or see Reverend Jackson while he's out there? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if he is going to see them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough. Q Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure about that. I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett. I don't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it. Q George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush. Is he going to be there, and is he going to meet with the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. Q What is the Mubarak schedule? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore. Q And joint statements tomorrow -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe so, yes. At the end, yes. Q Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As reported in The New York Times, I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a long period of time. We do have general intelligence sharing, I mean. But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward. The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind. Q George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I don't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview. He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action. But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all. Q So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, not at all. Q What's next with Serbia? It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: You didn't get to ask your question. Q Yes, exactly. Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries? And even if there wasn't, what does the U.S. do next? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement. Q George, why do you think sanctions is still an option? I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any time soon. The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan. When does no mean no and you have to do something different? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean we are doing something different. We're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue. We're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time. Q Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has said that this is something that is under consideration. Q George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's condition, how he's doing? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As far as I know nothing's changed. Q George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's a little unclear. I think we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit. Q Is he going somewhere for Easter? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not that I know of. Q What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks. I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks. Q Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not going to discuss the magnitude. Q How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where do you stand on that -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As the President said yesterday, he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it. He believes -- he's going to try and get it this week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a hard look at it. Q But they're making it up? I mean it's no White House involvement, Congress is compiling this list? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll be able to get our own researchers working as well. Q George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's something that's under discussion. Q Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, all I can say is that it's something that the President is reviewing. Right now we're working with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll continue to review other matters. Q George, can you tell us anything about the schedule this week? Any travel? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They just asked about that. I don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right now. Q Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- as you know, the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks. We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions. Thanks. ###

EDT Q Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's protest today? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's an informational protest. I think it's fine. The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management. I think we should. I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado. And I think it's time to make a move on that front. So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game. So, I think it's good. Q Do you think they're moving fast enough? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that it was a good first step. And I think you'll see some movement now. And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some. And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue. So I think it's fine. Q Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan? Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture? THE PRESIDENT: I don't know, we're working at it. I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up. They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play. In the Senate the majority does not rule. It's not like the country. It's not like the -- it's not like the House. If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule. And that's what they're doing. There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it. And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle. It's very sad. I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed. Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators. I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work. I think it's a mistake. THE PRESS: Thank you. END11:50 A.M. EDT

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks. That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks. In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more. That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong. By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so. It was reported* that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them. Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this. I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it. -- Clayton E.

Secondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after you for first one murder, then the next, etc. A "sovereign" has essentially one chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing). That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the deaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once. Of course, as we discovered in the Rodney King case, there are two "sovereigns", neither of which can try you twice for the same crime. Bruce E. Hayden (303) 758-8400 bhayden@csn.org

PST Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning. The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion. Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points. First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform. All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs. All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow. The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers. All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government. Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year. The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform. In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you. Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment. I think it's fair to say that Russia's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so. And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship. They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship. If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are. I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions. The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance. This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities. That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress. We'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million. The second item is concessional food sales. As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia. It's important to us and it's important to Russia that we continue that relationship. The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program. The value over the next seven months is $700 million. These are concessional terms. The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal. The third program is a collection of private sector support. We think this is one of the most important things we're going to do. Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow. And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million. And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses. The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis. He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation. This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia. The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself. I think it's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia. You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs. The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're launching. The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia. The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement. This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration. This is a demonstration project. What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union. We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction. And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units. We'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this. And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project. The sixth area is energy in the environment. They are two issues that the President feels strongly about. Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage. I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side. Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment. We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time. And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s. And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important. You'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia's membership in the GATT. Russia has had observer status. Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT. We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal. And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT. We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences. You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project. I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development. We think we'll get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference. Before I take any further questions, I'd like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements. Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs. The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program. That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million. The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled. This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility. And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system. So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years. So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians. Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory. And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them. And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process. Q The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan. Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the same one, why do you feel it's necessary? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: It's not the same deal. Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field. This is a new investment project. It's a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced today. So it's completely new. Q Can you tell us more about what's involved? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things. One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia. The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs. So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia. The Russians do as well, and it's good for an American company. And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee. Q So it's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's right. Q On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated. And we think it will. And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services. Q That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia. We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest. But I think the interest may even extend beyond that. And if so, the government will respond. Q What's the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward? And is there any current year budget costs -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that. I don't know the details of that. Q The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program. USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds. There will be a hit in the budget. I'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that. Q Can you talk about the Democracy Corps? Q and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Why don't I start with the Democracy Corps first. I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis. And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area. And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts. And so this is a presidential initiative. It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union. And we're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation. Q any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million. What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform. He'll be consulting with the Congress. When he returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time. Q Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money. First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food. So why did you decide to do it that way? Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia's inability to pay. How does this fit into that situation? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia. I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation. That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products. On December 1 of last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program. They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program. And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales. And I think we have two ways to do that. We've announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program. But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program. I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would. And that is what this program is. It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal. And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent. And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and it's important for the American farm community. Q I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me be explicit about that. We are prevented under the law to from continuing the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia's arrearages to the United States. All of you know about those arrearages. They total about, I think, around $640 million. USDA can give you an exact figure. So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to great effect in other parts of the world. And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution. I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments. Q Where do those funds actually come from? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's authority. USDA has the authority to spend these funds. We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds. And I want to make that general point again: Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow. And it's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments. And we are confident we'll be able to do so. Q How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There's a reason for it. The reason was that the Russian government told us that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time. And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the same level of food imports from the West. Q I would imagine there's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia. Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union. We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries. In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia. We will continue that. And I think it's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they're hard-hitting. Q Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight, not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment. And I'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning. We're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that. We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector. It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production. That's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis on it. That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton. And we're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them. Q My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We think he is. I would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector. He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector. We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee. And we're looking forward to the work. Q What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program? And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here? It depends on the program itself. In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source. That's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money. We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs. But they are all quite different. For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food. For grant medical assistance, we've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization. For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, we'll be working with a group of American PBOs. On some of the democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations. We're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed. So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways. Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens. Q The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship. The President has noted that. I think it's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and we'll get back to the Russian government. Q You were not prepared for these questions when you got here? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We were prepared for these questions. We've looked at them. But we're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend. They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik. They require consultation with the Congress. They require consultation with the American Jewish community. And we're very sensitive to those concerns. And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action. Q Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts. In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow. And that's the advantage of this particular initiative. Q If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think we've been clear about that. The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has. We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything. And we'll also want to consult with our allies. So that's where it stands now. Q We've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated. Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that we've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY'92. And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended. We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds. We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs. And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans. We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA. We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it. Q Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's from the Freedom Support Act funds. Q In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits. And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding. A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92. The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds. Q cooperation -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: From FY '92? I don't have the exact figure. It was not a considerable figure. Q Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's happened here -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning. In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues. That will be this morning's session. I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us. We've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them. Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation that's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev. And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially. But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I don't yet know. In a couple hours we'll know. Q? Just a follow-up on the financing here. Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been earmarked and put it into this fund? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note. We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding. We're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort. And we've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment. We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point: This package is FY '93. It's funds that we have. And we're going to do what we say we're going to do. And the President feels very strongly about that. In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package. And we'll do it. But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's part of the discussions on economics this weekend. We're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform. And we've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year. Q taken it way from any -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we haven't. Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia? The answer is no, we have not done so. Q In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else. Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not at all. I don't think it does. That's a particular example, and the example is grain sales. The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months. You all know about Russia's debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments. So we looked for a way to do two things: to meet Russia's requirement for grain. They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia. And we simply look for another way to finance that. And we have legislative authority to do it. This program has been successful in other areas. We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now. Q Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I don't think that's a fair characterization. A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992. This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made. But we had a long six to seven week review of this program. We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration. But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program. There was no number attached to it. In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative. Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons. And President Clinton has responded to that. And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers. I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience. And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective. So I would not characterize it that way at all. And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant. I was in the last administration. I'm very familiar with what the last administration did. And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia. Q There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people. Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it's being administered by the Russian government? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's intended. And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their source. I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government. Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses. The private enterprise support is another example of that. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that we've been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs. They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors. But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended. Q When would the democracy corps start? Exactly when do you see this happening? How would get it off the ground? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps. I think it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks. Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st. But in effect we've already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia. And we've said that we will be helpful. We've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government. We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another. We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts. Q Excuse me. How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that. Q This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and I'm sorry to say that. No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package. And he was briefed intensively on this. He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package. He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package. And I think it's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago. We have been refining it ever since. We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy. And so it's been evolving. But this particular package has been together for about two weeks. Q Where is Yeltsin's input into this then? There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth. Is that in the out years? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, it's both. President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them. And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package. We listened to him. On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details. So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way. But let me get at the other part of your question. The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake. And we're looking for his ideas. The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing. But we're looking for Russian ideas not. We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active. Q There's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago. We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here. Q I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers. Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You're right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States. Part of the housing initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions. Q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not yet allocated any money for that. Q Why not? Q of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units. Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If you want to do housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities. You've got to think about the purchase of land. You've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth. And it's also retraining. It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia. We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well. This is responding to a request from the Russian government. Q of the $6 million will go to retrain -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's right. Q Are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We're talking about single, individual dwellings. Q You're saying that only 450 families will be served by this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project. What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money. What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done. I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that. And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future . But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely. Q What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, look, I think it's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform. It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to our allies to do more as well. But beyond that, it's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform. We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests. Q Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States? So what is it about this program that does this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform. We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia. So it's not a simple question. You can't just say that this program is the answer. It's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it. Q And then on the question of Russia's ability to repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans. Q substantial government-to-government loan we've ever gotten into with the Russians? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I don't want to answer authoritatively on that. I don't go back 20 or 30 years on this. But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans. This is a different type of effort. Q government loans in any other sector that you recall? I know it wasn't done in -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think it's fair to say this is a new and unique effort. END10:25 A.M. PDT

Some more details would be appreciated. Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls were working. In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush "consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending increases. As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax increases). The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office. Chew on that awhile.

Subject: Re: Stop putting down white het males. From: <RIPBC@CUNYVM.BITNET> Organization: City University of New York Lines: 31 From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich) -BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic) - --- -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich baba@Tymnet.Com - I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan. The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda. It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character. Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path. The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely. The people who originally called themselves aryas, the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic. So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate. The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda. If you want to check what I am saying, look at Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed toward poorer people. In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a motivation of hatred for sexual orientation.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding.

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.

As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being. And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died. There is a significant difference. What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started? You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance. If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..." If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance? You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words. > >> >> 2) If she is, then why does the mother have the right to kill > >> >> her when she is in the womb but not after she has passed > >> >> through the birth canal? > >> > >> >Because a woman has a right to have any object which threatens her > >> >health and is within the confines of her body removed.

Again, your analogy fails. Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.

It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb. There. We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical. For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well. The systems are dependent on each other for life. I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so. > >> Of course, the situation is NOT a perfect comparison; it may well be that > >> one siamese twin deliberately initiates oppression or coersion against > >> the other.

Your argument is from Fantasy Island. Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically. And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous. As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure. On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version. As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive. And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal. You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards? What is different about the two situations? I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you. In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake. You can't have it both ways. Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway. Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was. To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc. She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit your needs. The principle of protecting life is abandoned based on "action versus inaction." Not much of a principle. Suddenly you recognize that the claim on bodily resources is dependent on circumstances other than this principle of life. That's a very conevnient principle you have there, Matt. Dean Kaflowitz

So guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab (just as you might have expected) for people who have never contributed a dime to the U.S. society. I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP. If they want to help Haitians....how about removing the illegal government, how about giving them development aid? IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying non-citizens who will never be productive in either this country or their own. It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly help 100 people in Haiti per 1 AIDS-infected non-citizen immigrant.

(I'm assuming > that, like all good people, you oppose the marital exemption for rape, > so I won't bring that up.) In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and (Huh? Wha? Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do with the discussion at hand? :-) When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Having you ask about classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question from scratch. What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law. Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not protected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society. This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their "contribution to society." I view that doctrine as being both (a) personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking members of the Executive Branch of the federal government. -- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

I have just been informed of what I feel is one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people don't like what he says or thinks. We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel. Although many of us have not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in them. I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought) in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please. If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed. I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via netmail...) While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think). The issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?" Apparently, Ted and Mark think so... 1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken *off the net* from last year. If reposting an article constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one had posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek", would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of "proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and behold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad! If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get "Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they only get "I don't like what that user is doing because...". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through. In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for the info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...") NWO Indeed! Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.

It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started. It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...

That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system. Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg 49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%. So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of German voters. Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties. Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed Chancellor. What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under. Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis. If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had begun to decline. Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher, who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others, knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together. Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_: The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength, in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out. True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him *before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties (Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis. Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over. ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610

I would have thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to dampen the belief that price controls can actually work. As for government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what the are saying. We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion of the budget and they must be 'controlled'. We are presented with horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies. We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get in our government run hospitals. We are just now seeing stories about how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that should come as any surprise).

Thanks for straightening me out. ------------------------------ Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK. -RSW >>() No, it is not "double jeopardy."

If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was racially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW -- * Richard STEVEn Walz rstevew@deeptht.armory.com (408) 429-1200 * * 515 Maple Street #1 * Without safe and free abortion women are * * Santa Cruz, CA 95060 organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.* * * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women. *

EDT SECRETARY RILEY: Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April. You know, today is April 13th. In 1743, Thomas Jefferson was born, 250 years ago. I think that's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country. The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system. His philosophy of government, his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening. Tonight we're so pleased to have with us President Clinton. He's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios. Mr. President, it's good to have you. We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening. Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also. I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure many of you do, too. So please call us if there's something that you'd like to ask. The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782. In Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171. I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us. And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that at this time. It's great to have you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place. I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen. This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together. And if you'll forgive me a little home state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight. I appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you. I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country. Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday. If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything, he believed in these three things: first, in education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change. If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times. For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world. We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better. Unless we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the long run. We also have to have people who can carry their load. And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime. It's not just important what you know, but what you can learn. And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition. And we're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time. Dick, I think I ought to stop there. That's a good place we can begin, I think, the discussion. SECRETARY RILEY: Thank you so much, Mr. President. Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals. And tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work. This week, the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth. The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country. Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the Summer Youth Challenge. Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs. And why in your words is that so important? THE PRESIDENT: I think it's important for two reasons. First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning. And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime. And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before. Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning. We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners. And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on. SECRETARY RILEY: Well, I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year, is really even greater. Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs throughout the year. And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training. SECRETARY REICH: Well, what we've learned, Mr. Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning. Many young people, for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry. But when they actually are there building something or working on something, and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry, they understand what it's used for. And a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important. It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer. SECRETARY RILEY: Thank you. Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship program, school-to-work transition. And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing. THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let's talk about why it's important. Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma. If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade. The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their employers. So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes two years of further training either in a community college, a vocational setting, or perhaps on the job. And what I have done in this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, based on the needs of the economy in any given area. It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers. SECRETARY REICH: I should add, Mr. President -- I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many of our states, building a school-to-work transition program. In fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement. The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that. And more power to them. Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there. SECRETARY RILEY: Bob, we're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning career academies. And what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important? SECRETARY REICH: Well, one thing that we've seen -- and you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential. And I'm so delighted that we're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber. The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future. Communities have got to come together. I mean, this is one of the most important things. You've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together. You know, too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody is talking, but they're not really working together in a common strategy. And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence. This is not a tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to make it. This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for. If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college, that's fine. That ought to be permissible. But we're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation skills for on-the-job learning. And again, those are the critical components. It's already being done. THE PRESIDENT: I think -- if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, but also in monitoring that excellence. If you have the right sort of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them. So I think that's very important. And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile. SECRETARY RILEY: That's great. We've been talking, of course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall. But let's talk just a moment about long-term school reform. It's something especially close to me. Mr. President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long. THE PRESIDENT: Well, as you know, back when you and I were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize. I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President Bush's administration back in 1989. And what we're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, disciplined, and drug-free. And, of course, the fifth goal --I took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country. And each one of those goals there's a national role, a state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector role. And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet. It's very exciting. So far as I know, nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before. Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job. I'm really excited about it. SECRETARY RILEY: Well, I am, too. And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts, all driven by high standards. That's the point. Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to the telephone calls. It's about the same subject. We have, of course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and I wonder if you would comment on that. SECRETARY REICH: Well, you know, we have 75 percent of our young people who don't graduate from college. Very often they don't have very many alternatives. They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential, many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs. Everybody doesn't have to go to college. Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical, preprofessional skills. We can do it in this country. If you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser. And we want to develop those national skill standards. We're going to be working with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private industry in developing those standards. And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around, as well as our business community. SECRETARY RILEY: Well, that's great. Why don't we go ahead and go to the telephone. We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin, Texas. Q Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today. We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative. Let me simply say, amen to some of the comments made already. We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are very supportive. We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years. We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance. Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike. But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate. We know summertime is important. Year-round is even more important. And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis? And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort. SECRETARY RILEY: Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: I think I'll give everybody a chance to answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin. I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed. First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector, too. We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer. And we're working on that. Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis. And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning. An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when they're doing than when they're reading or just listening. So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question. Bob, do you want to say anything? SECRETARY REICH: Well, you took most of the words out of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual. But let me just add one thing, and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of jobs. And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously. It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the economy back on track. That's sort of the prerequisite to everything else. If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater. This is a jobless recovery. A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June. And even if we did everything right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs. SECRETARY RILEY: Thank you both. Of course, Goals 2000 will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year. It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways. And then the state, with all the various school districts, a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement. And I think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that moving. The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York. Doctor? Q Good evening, Mr. Secretary. It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening. As you may know, bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages we have forged with the local schools. We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy. And over the years, we've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work. And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the development of high performance competencies. My question, then is: How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience? And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration? SECRETARY RILEY: Well, thank you very much. I think -- and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting work going on there. We're going to have three people, our next guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later. You all care to comment -- any comments you might have? THE PRESIDENT: I'd just like to say, if I might, one thing. I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I. I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important. And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning. I think we should keep the liberal arts going. I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program. SECRETARY REICH: It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students. They're important for all students. It's not just a special group of students that needs them. Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments. They're mainstreaming all the students. At 11th and 12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program. And again, the kids can either go on to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions. But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools. SECRETARY RILEY: Thank you, very much. I think that's going to be the last call that we have time for. Mr. President, I think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here. We appreciate your time and your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us. END9:00 P.M. EDT

Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v. <*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State. While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the "Court of Appeals." To make matters worse, New York also calls its _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"... Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)): Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's plant near Albany, N.Y. (The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.) In the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property. (Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me. Boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.) Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages. In other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain. A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong. (Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain. But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...) Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that "What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages." Blackmail? (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition.... "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose disgraceful defects. This crime is commonly included under extortion statutes.") How do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying? Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price? As I see it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted. There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings. You go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation." If so, so what? Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties? If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business? (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.) And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided." As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole." They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them. And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole. And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided? (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) > Is _Boomer_ really being taught as "infamous?" That's really sad if > it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible. > You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of > filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever > inexplicable reasons. (1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my school. (Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally. When the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions. This is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar. End of aside.) I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it. For the reasons I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call "economic correctness" over justice. (2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. (And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.) > You'd like Posner, Bill. He's a libertarian. Really? I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_? > Of course, he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a > president, Democrat (won't like his antitrust stance) or Republican > (won't like his support of gay marriage), and if bright law students > "shiver" at what they don't understand, it's easy to imagine how the > press will play it up as baby-selling. (I've seen Mike Godwin claim > that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything > and is the end-all and be-all, when Posner says precisely the > opposite.) So it goes. I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as "law and economics" is weak. If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine. But as illustrated by _Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case. -- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

The fact is, the major claim made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" -- has absolutely no validity.

Way back in today's newspaper (Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle) there is an article about the document that held the proof. [used without permission] "The document, which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, is a Russian translation of what is described as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the North Vietnamese army." [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205 Americans in North Vietnamese prisons] "Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4 in central Vietnam." 2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues to become members of the Church.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers To: National Desk, Defense Writer Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, 202-479-2258 WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers. In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel. ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future." He asked the commission "to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action." "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman. "The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations." Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve. ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities. If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities." Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont. Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas. A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El Toro, Calif., plus six others. -30- -- Nigel Allen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada ndallen@r-node.hub.org

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. The speech that Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of those who are here. I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around America who are here. This has been a pretty fun day. (Laughter.) I loved hearing the young people sing. It was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about. (Applause.) A year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because I was concerned about their future. Because I believe that our country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to take us into the future. I entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people. But in the process we might recreate the best of America's community, knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future. All of you here today are committed to that. The 1,000 jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, and those who are around the country. The work that Nancye Combs does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're on the right track. Last July when I was traveling across America's heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in Louisville, Kentucky. And there I met young people and business people who were participating in the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership. I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today. I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work. I saw, as I have seen many times in my own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about -- that for millions of American young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning. In the world in which we are living, the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime. We must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better. And we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today. Whether you're in business or in government or in education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all of our people. There are still a lot of people who say, well, things are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing. They all have jobs. (Laughter.) All the people who say that. (Applause.) They all have health insurance. They all have a pretty good education. And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they'll be okay no matter what happens. I say that not to be either political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work for them to do. All the European countries have higher unemployment rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the unemployed. The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up. They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that I have proposed to create jobs. In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours. This is a big problem for advanced nations. It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people. But it is especially important for America for two reasons: One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this. The second is, even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors. People need to be able to work in this country. (Applause.) We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some of it is normal. You've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another. We have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs. But in the whole, we must still be able to create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the chance to work. It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job. (Applause.) So we have two tasks. One is to develop the capacity of the American people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth. The other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck. It is a great challenge. I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple. But I know if you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you have got to have opportunity in that mix. A part of our vision for America has to be a future for every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow. There has to be something at the end of that rainbow. And that is what we are basically here to talk about today: What can we all do as partners, recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background. And then, what can we do to make sure that there's something there for them to do? The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness, community. It will put the people first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector. I said when I addressed the United States Congress in February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the American business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before. Many, many people have responded to that challenge. And Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience. And it is terribly important. I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go. All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan. It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs. The emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent. It would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created. It also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment. The summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government has never fully emphasized before. A lot of these young people, as you well know, because they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other areas. And a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year. What we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment. There will be more applied academics, more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future. The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs. They're designed to make a future for the people holding the job. And that's what they will do. In the process, they'll help to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve local problems. Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, and learning all the way. Challenging young people to learn while they earn, but letting them earn. You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the opportunity that's at the end of the effort. I have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that. But if you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity. (Applause.) The young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom. They will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat. They will have a sense of accomplishment. It will literally be a summer challenge, but a challenge that will take them into a different life. So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even as I, as your President, support your effort. At the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate. We'll see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved ahead. I suspect that they will. This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I will be visiting many of your communities. We'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well. We want to honor the companies and the communities, the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer. And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort, I thank you. And to all of you who haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today, I want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer. I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when we don't give these children anything to say yes to. If we exhort them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them. (Applause.) When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up here on the platform, listening and reveling. And they got talking about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've done to make a living in my life. When I was 13, I made a very foolish short-term business investment: I set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books. Made more money than I had ever had in my life. But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be worth $100,000 today. (Laughter.) That does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial. It just means that you can't foresee a generation ahead. I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership. And I've done a lot of different things for a living. Some people say I got into politics to escape work. (Laughter.) I learned something from every job I ever had. But I grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a job. I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is, get an education and you'll be all right. You'll get a job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year. Now I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life. And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want. Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things: It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created in this country. Machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages. So nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of America's work force. And anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding. On the other hand, we need to be honest. Every wealthy country in the world, including the United States, is having difficulty creating jobs. If I knew everything that needs to be done I'd be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberations of Congress and everything else. I don't have all the answers. But I know this: Doing nothing is not the answer. (Applause.) And so the jobs program that I have presented to Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the counties, through the Community Development Program, with the infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget. It is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again. Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government money. And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American economy obviously will come from the private sector. That's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well. But this is the challenge we have. So I ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government should create this summer, so that together we can have this partnership. Because more than anything else, we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in. We need to send them a message that here in America if you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country. You can build a future from you own dreams. That has always been the promise of America. Together that's what this summer of challenge needs to be: a reaffirmation of the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion. We can make it a reality. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END11:45 A.M. EDT 
From: Clinton-HQ@Campaign92.Org (Clinton/Gore '92) Subject: CLINTON: Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.14.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 996 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 14, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12:40 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess I'm just prepared to take questions today. Q George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration. Obviously, this is a tragic situation in Bosnia. And if the Bosnian Serbs don't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo. In the meantime, we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U.N. We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the table. Q How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're working on that right now. Q It's been a long time. Q On February 19th, the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio. And when he was asked about it later by reporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States. It's something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead." Questioned again about it later he says, "It is not something that is now under consideration. If we start considering it, I'll tell you." It wasn't a trial balloon or anything, he said. I was just discussing the tax response to a question. Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - "Certainly we're looking at a VAT." What's gone on? Q The same with Alice Rivlin this morning. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The health care task force is reviewing a number of options. They haven't made any decisions yet. And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not going to comment on decisions that haven't been made. Q But you have also said from this podium time and time again -- Q Wait a minute. Whoa, Nelly. Whoa. Q that that was not under consideration. Q Yes. Clinton says, "It is not something that is now under consideration." Is that no longer true? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe the working group, as Ms. Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been made of any kind. Q Well, I know. But he said he'd tell us about it if it was ever under consideration. I take it that now he is and he didn't tell us about it or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed? Q "If we start considering I'll tell you." MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: If it's something to be proposed? Q "If we start considering it, I'll tell you." That's a direct quote. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The task force has looked at a number of different options. They have not made any decisions yet. The President has not made any decisions yet. This is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system. They have cast a very wide net. They have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals. But the President has not made any decisions. Q Well, is the President aware of their consideration of this option? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind. I don't know that that's gotten to his level. He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe that that's been presented to him, no. Q Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, he's going through it in a very deliberate fashion. There are a number of decisions that have to be made. I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point. Q If this is still under consideration, that's a change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about three weeks ago or so. She said, that is not an option, talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice. Is that not the case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I don't know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force. Q It was ruled it out, though. I mean, unlike other options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled out. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, this is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind. I mean, it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase. The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options. Q If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now, then something has changed, George. Yes, no? Q When a guy says in February -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options. Q So something's changed. They weren't looking at it before; they're looking at it now. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I don't know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet. They are casting a very wide net. Q How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that, in fact, it is being considered? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the working groups are looking at a wide range of options. They have not -- Q Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't deny that -- I mean, those are the President's words. Those are very clear. Q Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know about the timing. I think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say they stand. Q So don't they stand any longer? Q March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, those words -- the President did say that in February. The working groups are on a separate track, and as I said, I don't believe -- Q Separate from the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe this has been presented to the President. Q Are they considering something that the President -- Q Has ruled out? Q has ruled out? I mean, will the President consider a VAT tax? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the working groups have not presented this to the President. They have looked at a wide range of options. I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly listen to it. That does not mean he has decided to do it. Q Can we put this another way? In his answer in Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system. Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point. Is that no longer the case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. Q He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health care, for example. Q Or anything else. Q Or anything else. Q It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. Q Has that change, too? Q Is that still his view? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I haven't spoken about those specific comments. I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT? Yes, they have. Q Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They have examined the possibility of a VAT. Has it been presented to the President? Has he made a decision? No, he has not. Q What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at? Is the President concerned about that sort of thing? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that the President's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible. He's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the different alternatives. If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the President will explain and justify. But no decision has been made along those lines. Q What does it mean exactly, though, when the President rules something out? Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's just -- that's indisputably true. If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in. He has not made a proposal. Q What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open to it before? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's certainly willing to listen to the argument. Q Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in Chilicothe? He's now open to it -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing, not something he was floating. Q Not something he was considering. Those are his words -- "It's not something that's now under consideration. If we start considering it, I'll tell you." You're now acknowledging, are you not, that it is under consideration and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal. I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it. Q But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Obviously, the working groups are looking at it. Again, but the President has not made a decision. Q Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know that. I assume that if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing. I don't know that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him. I know this is something the working groups are looking at. Q Do you understand, George, that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made, only about what the President is considering? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that, and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT. Q And the President will consider it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him. Q Does that mean the President -- that working groups think that when the President says no, he means maybe? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible. Q George, can I ask you another question about Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. (Laughter.) Q No, he wants us to stay on this. Q Let's do gays in the military. (Laughter.) Q No, he got out of that swamp. Q I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT. Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies." That seems to go a bit further than what you've just said -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds almost exactly what I just said. Q Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept what Reggie -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the President has said that this is something that's under consideration. It is something he will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the table. Q Isn't there some kind of timetable here? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, there is a timetable. There's going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days. Q That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the sanctions. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's right, that's sanctions. And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table. As you know, Mr. Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table. We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well. Q The question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, not the sanctions. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The next vote in the U.N. is on sanctions. As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo. But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies. Q Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U.S. would do that? What was the point of his telling them that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, clearly, I mean, this is something that's under consideration, and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table. They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table. Q Have they been given a deadline? Q Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least. Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just don't accept the premise of your question. It has had an effect; the embargo is having an effect. Q What effect? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings, then they will face the consequences. Q What effect has it had in Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the effect that it has had on the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through. We can brief more fully -- Q In Bosnia, George. In Bosnia what effect has it had? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to date. That is why we're continuing to press for the Serbians to stop. But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have an effect. I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't happened overnight. But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs. If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo. Q Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote? Hasn't the United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We've said continually we're going to -- Q But on that deadline? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't have a specific date, but we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, by around that time. And if that fails to take effect, if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other actions. Q Isn't this awfully incremental? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're taking a step-by-step approach. We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to continue to do that. Q Is there a possibility, George, that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression. We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts. We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions. And we will consider lifting the arms embargo. We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that. Q But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained? I mean, once they're entrenched -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I can't speculate on that. We're going to continue to press for them to come to the table now. We're going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression. But I can't see into the future. Q George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package. They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it. What's your strategy to counter that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The strategy we have is the one we're going to continue. As you saw, the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide: 700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work. We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways. We're going to point up the benefits of immunization. We're going to point up the benefits of Head Start. We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice: they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. Q Does it concern you, though, that the House now, the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The House Republicans voted against it before. They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now. Q George, does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a reaffirmation of a promise of America"? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I think it's the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential. Q Government-funded jobs? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: To give people a chance to work? Absolutely. That is the promise of America. Q I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That is on top of. I did look at it. There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline. This will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million. Q The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Where does that number come from? Because we've been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs. And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, but the summer -- that's when you do their full-time equivalence. I mean, 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer. When you calculate it for the full-time job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is. Q Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- 150,000 or -- Q One to four because it's three months. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you. Q Can I follow up on that? Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not necessarily. I mean, I think that there will be grants available. That's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs. At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well. Q Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to work at Time-Warner? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the Time-Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant. That's going to be the bulk of it. There could be isolated instances, though, where there would be grants to businesses. Q Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House. Q At a lower level. But the President hasn't? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has not, no. Q Getting any closer to get the votes? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're continuing to work on it. Q Anybody leaning your way? Q On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup leaders. Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what impact will it have on the process? And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Pezzullo did brief the principals. I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks. I would leave that to the negotiators themselves. But Mr. Caputo has returned to Haiti. We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo. And as we have said time and time again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement. Q George, yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities. Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we have it for most states, yes. And I think we can get it out. Q Could you make that generally available? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe we can. Q And could you do it by the component of the stimulus? In other words -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if we can do -- I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs. I don't know how deeply it can be broken down. But clearly, we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs. Q And can I follow up? Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they're ads, but they're press releases. Q Can you describe what those press releases contain? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: All we're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states. For instance, I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire. And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont. It creates 2,000 jobs in New Hampshire. And the people of those states should remind him that this is important. Q Where are the releases going? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They go to the states. Q To whom? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We can get them. It's no problem. Q Can we get it? Q Why don't you put them out here as well? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we can. Q This afternoon? Would that be possible? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'll have to check. I don't know. But as soon as we can. Q Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we're trying to get as many as we can. It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we're doing our best. We're putting them out as we get them. Q Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's schedule? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I was just following it. Q Are press releases going along to states where he's visiting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure. I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont. (Laughter.) Q Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting? (Laughter.) Q George, as the President goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up with the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument. And how do you answer that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: What was answer is, we are paying for it over time. And if you look at our budget, we pay for this package over time. We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs. Q You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add to the deficit this year? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm saying we're paying for it over time. I didn't say that. Q I know that, George. But I mean, from the beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: This year they clearly will. But over time our budget fully pays for this program. Q What you're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. That's exactly what I said. Q I know that, but there is going to be outstanding debt, it will add to the national debt from this year -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, we're reducing the deficit by $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years. Q You mean you're reducing it below what it would have been? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Exactly. Q In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: But we're reducing it far more from what it would have been. That's true. Q Washington-type reduction. (Laughter.) Q You're getting to be a grumpy old man. Q George, has any decision been made about the White House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're working on the President's schedule now. I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend. Q Will he address it by phone? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know about that. It's a little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat. Q So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups. I don't know the schedule on it, though. Q Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. Q April 22nd is Earth Day. What is the President going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know there's been some work on the biodiversity treaty. I don't know about signing it that day, but I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around then. Q Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'd have to check with Katie McGinty. I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't know exactly what. Q When is Earth Day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The 22nd, I think. Q Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I said I don't know if he's going to meet or when he's going to meet. Q Do you have a statement on the gay rights march? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't, actually, no. I wouldn't be surprised if he did, though. Q Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries. Q There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if I understand, it hasn't happened. Why is that or what's the status on that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The G-7 meeting is still going on and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package. But we're going to continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that. Q? We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The meeting's not over yet. Q Is that when you're going to make one? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not ruling out the possibility. Q the President's going to announce it tomorrow. Q Bentsen said that. Q Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow. Q So did Christopher. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'd have to look at that, but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo. Q George, has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know that there's -- it's not something we've ruled out. We don't have a date set for it. Q George, you all have a position or do you support Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's the first I've heard of it. Q George, there was a report today about the -- Q Fortunately. (Laughter.) Q about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for. Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We filled 814 of the President's appointments. And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time. I'm not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time. And this is about the same -- it's about the same pace of President Bush. Obviously, as you move along farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments. So we expect the process to speed up. But we're at the pace of Bush. Obviously we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible. I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup. But we're working on it. Q Is that because of Nannygate? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's an awful big part of it, yes. Q In the story this morning, you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way behind in winning confirmations. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's where the background checks comes into play. That's the problem. Q That's the background checks problem? Because I mean, you have a Democratic Senate -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, that's not the -- you make the appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done. That's exactly where the problem is. Q What's the President doing this afternoon, and what's on the plan for tomorrow? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He's got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues. And then he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House. And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting. Q Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Either tomorrow or Friday. Q Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know about tomorrow, but we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these visits. Q Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He was here. He met with a group of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty. Q Who? Q Reverend Jackson. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Reverend Jackson. Mack McLarty, me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. Q Talking about Haiti? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We talked about general urban policy. He is about to go to Los Angeles. He was just back from Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going on to Los Angeles. Q Did he request the meeting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Actually, no. He's in continual contact with the President. He had written a letter on a variety of issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it. Q George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont. Have you guys been in contact with Jeffords at all on this? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think there's been some contact, sure. Q Can you tell us about the contacts? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure -- Q Do you know who contacted him or what was said? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package. Q And did he express his support for it now, or is he -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I can't divulge the details of the conversation, but there have been conversations. Q The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package. Is this something the President is considering? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again -- Q Along with the VAT? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's certainly something that's been looked at, but no decisions have been made. Q What was the question? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The L.A. Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President's health plan. Q Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L.A.? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues. Q For instance, did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles. That was certainly one of them. Q Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, good. Q your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action. We will continue to do that. Q Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise? I mean, we don't have any feel except talks are ongoing. Have you talked to like 20 people or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know the numbers. We've talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions. Q Anyone leaning your way? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I can't get into that. We're just going to keep working through Tuesday. THE PRESS: Thank you. END 1:10 P.M. EDT #56-04/14

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge "The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that Hitler was original and showed initiative." --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, October 27, 1992. (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel. My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery. Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt. The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement. In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that. Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States. Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words. But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days.) Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a RICO indictment. On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For example: On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" (page 577). Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.) On Religion as the Basis of a Nation Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.) Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.) On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.) Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.) On the News Meida Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.) Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.) * * * To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading. After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America. And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on. The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701- 0845; (608) 255-4460. --- 30 ---

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. The Security Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina. There have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages in Bosnia have been bombed. In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi- zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance. NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air enforcement for the no-fly zone. The U.N. Secretary General was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating allies. The United States actively supported these decisions. At my direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. forces initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft. These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. e.d.t. on April 12, 1993. The fighter aircraft are equipped for combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense. NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft. The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea. Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order). If these steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved more (OVER) 2 rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will be necessary. The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully considered before the rules of engagement were approved. It is not possible to predict at this time how long such operations will be necessary. I have directed U.S. armed forces to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. I am grateful for the con- tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward toward attainment of our goals in this region. Sincerely, WILLIAM J. CLINTON # # #

This is because they had no environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity at any expense to justify their political systems. Luckily for us, some of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws. That isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.

From: demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer) Subject: The state of justice Organization: ACME Products Lines: 23 Summary: GM's quest for justice A judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not from the fire. Thoughts? It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led to the previous ruling appear. Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? Shouldn't that be up to a jury? And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM? Shouldn't that be enough for a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial? Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?
